The Gardens are over 450 years old and we°Øre made to look like they are 1000 years old. They did a great job. They added to it in recent years to look like the aged gardens were always there. The buildings and pagodas and landscaping were beautiful.

There are loads of tour groups but also the tour group leaders will send their party in and wait for them to emerge. So the best time to see the gardens is either very early or late in the afternoon when all the tour groups have gone. As for the garden it is a maze of paths through buildings and rocks over bridges that span waterways. Its a Chinese garden so not many flowers and not a blade of grass.

2018Âπ¥10Êúà26Êó•,50,On a recent business trip to Shanghai we took a day to tour the city since it was the first time for most of us. We asked our concierge to pick an English tour operator and Cindy was great. They are a small private tour guide in a mini van and not sure the name of company but we stayed at the Hyatt on the Bund. Cindy only does private small groups. We let her tell us what we were seeing and we‚Äôre very happy with the tour. We felt Yu Gardens was the highlight because you were in the city but felt like you were transported to another time. The Gardens are over 450 years old and we‚Äôre made to look like they are 1000 years old. They did a great job. They added to it in recent years to look like the aged gardens were always there. The buildings and pagodas and landscaping were beautiful. I highly recommend this area for a visit and stop to visit the kiosks along the way to buy unique musical instruments or in the gardens they have some made of china and sell vases and other unique pottery and Jewlery.

2018Âπ¥10Êúà8Êó•,40,These gardens are in the old quarter of the city so just getting to them is a fun experience passing all the shops stalks and fast food outlets. The gardens are inexpensive and even cheaper if you are over 60 like me. The big problem is their popularity. There are loads of tour groups but also the tour group leaders will send their party in and wait for them to emerge. So the best time to see the gardens is either very early or late in the afternoon when all the tour groups have gone. As for the garden it is a maze of paths through buildings and rocks over bridges that span waterways. Its a Chinese garden so not many flowers and not a blade of grass. There are koi carp to feed and an exhibition of Chinese art. There is also a shop selling paintings but as soon as you enter you will be followed by a rep eager to sell you a painting. ,,,,en,Crowded ,,N6041QHdavids
