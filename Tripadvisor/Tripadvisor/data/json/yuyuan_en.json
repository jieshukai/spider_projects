Well worth a visit.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

But ,,, the gardens are spectacular and a true representation of what would have been a family's or a scholar's private garden for reflection, discussion and contemplation. Like all Chinese gardens of this quality, much use is made of stone and seasonal trees. Paths wander through lovely arcades of plants and arching trees and, dependent on the season, a blaze of colour from variegated flower bearing trees. This really is lovely, but head for the park as soon as you can. You can experience the retail dross on your exit. There is a nice tea house at the end of the zig zag bridge, which does at least contemplate for the loss of authenticity. The temple is also worth a (paid) visit.

It was extremely crowded in the evening when we went and it made it harder when people crowd around you and insist on taking photos at each and every site.

Texture, color and pattern all mattered to the designers, and different types of trees and plants had special significance, so all was carefully planned.

Their teas are in glass jars, which is not ideal if they sit for days, but they seemed to have good turnover. I tried and bought their ginseng oolong, which they have in factory sealed bags of 250g or you can buy custom amounts and they will scoop it into a bag and seal it for you. The cost on the ginseng oolong was 36 yuan for 50g or 180 yuan for the 250g bag. We bought 3 of the 250g bags so we bargained for a discount down to 160 yuan per bag (incidentally this was roughly the same price as our tea factory and about half the price as other top quality places we saw elsewhere). There were a few tea chain stores with cute boxes and good smelling tea, but people said that tea was cheap tea and you couldn't try it there (though the price was right at 25 yuan for a little 75g tin...half the price of the good tea that I did get).

The highlight was a visit to the tea house where we're totally absorbed in the ritual of tea preparation and drinking.

There are many restaurants and shops around the entrance, and LOTS of people. This is a major tourist attraction for Chinese and foreigners alike. We were warned to safeguard our wallets/purses in this area. The tea house at the entrance is the one depicted on old Blue Willow China- make sure to take time to appreciate its architecture. Inside the garden the noise disappears and quiet reigns. This is a huge garden with many areas, so it never seemed crowded. Everywhere you look there is a wonder- ponds full of koi, small pavilions, stone bridges, secret gardens. The flowers were lovely, and I really enjoyed the stone/rock formations. The bonsai collection was also a favorite. Make sure you look up- every rooftop is adorned with magical little figurines. For a great, inexpensive meal, visit the cafeteria on the second floor of the building across from the entrance to the park.

We found a great Volunteer Guide, who offered us some great advice! Don't be led into a shop, just walk in off the street, stay on the ground floor, don't go upstairs or below the shop! She pointed us in the right direction and off we went! The Zig Zag bridge entrance is amazing and really crowded! The parents had their first experience of having their photos took with the locals! They felt like Superstars. The Garden is amazing! Overflowing with a 500 year old history this place is amazing. The buildings are beautiful, there are Art Galleries and Tea Houses that you can wonder around. You can easily lose a couple of hours wondering around and taking in the surroundings.

I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the gardens - though, with so many tourists, they are certainly not as serene and peaceful as I'm sure they once were. This is due, in no large part, to the shopping bazaar located just outside the gardens - selling ice cream, food - including a very famous dumpling restaurant, pearls, chopsticks, paintings, fans - and many other Chinese treasures. The area is definitely tourist central and a study in contrasts - the lovely gardens vs. the chaotic shopping area! Definitely worth the visit - for both.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

They took me to a shop where the three of us were entertained for the better part of an hour (in a small, closed room) by a young woman who gave us samples of several teas. The cost was presented up-front as $8 for tea, and $7 for the presenter -- only later (when the bill comes) are you advised that each tea is charged separately, and you now owe them more than $50. I found it easier to fork over the cash than risk unknown consequences of refusal, but needless to say, I was not a happy camper.

We had to walk through tiny back streets, cut across a park, and zig zag in and out of what seemed like thousands of Chinese all intent on selling us wheels to add to our trainers and other dubious accessories....some were jovial and pleasant....others were actually quite unpleasant, shouting in our faces and jostling us roughly. As a first experience of China it was a culture shock! I wish it had been possible to walk slowly and take in the scene as we were actually walking through what appeared to be the real Shanghai....people buying goods from tiny back street shops and hanging their laundry (yes including their bras and pants!) along the park railings to dry in the sun!). Anyway we were pleased to be inside the beautiful Yu Yuan Gardens....really peaceful and beautiful (in April)....and really enjoyed wandering along the little paths and around the ponds and bridges. Our tour guide did an excellent job of filling us in with all the historical facts. We found it very atmospheric...and quite bizarre in that such a tranquil ancient place looked as if it had been dropped into one of the noisiest, crowded spots on earth (obviously it was there first but it was slightly incongruous!). We came out of the back door....and were thrust into the frenzy again! Hoards of (mainly Chinese) tourists fighting for space around the famous tea house, the zig zag bridge, and the souvenir/food shops. At that time we appeared to be the only European tourists there, and we were a source of great amusement and curiosity to the Chinese tourists (not the city people) who variously stared or asked to take photos of us! I absolutely loved our stay in Shanghai (as my dad had done many years before!) it was as crazy, frenetic and noisy as I'd imagined.......and the Yu Yuan Gardens are a lovely oasis of calm in the midst of it all!", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

The garden is separated into four sections including the western, eastern, central and the internal areas. Sansui Hall in the western section was built in 11760 and was originally used to entertain the guests. Later, it turned into ceremonial hall for the gentlemen and bookmen.

It was very busy on the Saturday I went, which I heard it wasn't too busy during the week. I loved the Koi and architect buildings. It was also very neat I was touring a 500-700 year old garden. This is a Koi lover's dream. The market was also neat, but packed with people. It had modern places like Starbucks, Dairy Queen, etc also with many local shops. The locals love to approch you and ask if you want an IPAD or ROLEX. I guess those are popular knock offs there.

As most tour books will point out, it has both the blessing and curse of being the only complete garden of its type in Shanghai, thereby seemingly having every tourist stop by on their way around town. I visited on a Saturday early in the morning and although there were a healthy amount of visitors around it wasn’t quite as infested as I would have thought (unlike the outside bazaar, which was downright crowded). I must admit up front that I’m not a garden enthusiast and largely stopped by out of obligation. That aside, it was a fairly interesting diversion for the day and much of the scenery can be appreciated even by us amateurs. There are numerous halls and pavilions with English signage and many areas with nooks and crannies to walk around, in addition to more than enough photo opportunities for those inclined. I got lost a couple times but this is part of the fun I think.
