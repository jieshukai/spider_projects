We took the Metro to get to an area near the French Concession, and used one of our guidebooks & its enclosed map to navigate the area. We started at Fuxing Park, a huge and lovely old park. It has various areas: a lotus pond with picnic shelters at its edges, a path with mini caves, a rose garden with arbors and benches, a large Italian-style garden plaza with a fountain, and a children's park with several rides and activities. People were singing Chinese opera in the picnic shelters and by the Italian garden, others were just strolling through or enjoying the benches in the shade. There are several shady walkways that go by various statues, some decorative, some historic. We also followed the guidebook's walking tour, passing several historic homes of former Communist leaders, writers, and artists. These were not open on the Monday we were there, but looked interesting enough to warrant a visit next time we come. We stopped at the historic Moller Mansion, now the Moller Mansion Hotel, and took several pictures. The brickwork is beautifully done, as is the woodwork inside the hotel. You can walk around the grounds to a sushi restaurant there, or have tea at the hotel's own restaurant. Beautiful landscaping & interesting historical photos and descriptions. This looks like a lovely place to stay. We wandered through the little streets, enjoying the sights, the shops, and the laundry strung from windows to coiled power lines along the street on wooden poles. We found a fun restaurant that looked like something out of The Jetsons-very futuristic, and had a delicious meal, chosen from the photo-rich menu. We ended up at Xiangyang Park, on the northwest corner of the French Concession. There, we saw patients from the hospital next to the park practicing Tai Qi to regain range of motion and balance, men gambling at cards and Mah Jong, a fitness area, an area dedicated to badminton, and beautiful flower gardens. We'd come this far because the only remaining Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai is nearby, but that turned out to be the only disappointment of the day. The once-blue domes have been repainted black, and a series of businesses in that location have failed, leaving it empty & locked up. There isn't even a descriptive plaque to explain its history. Wandering back toward the middle of the French Concession, we found our Metro station & headed back to our hotel. A long, lovely walking day, with many more attractions to visit when we come again.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

Not just a few criss-crossing streets. It has been massacred ruthlessly by cut-in, multi-million, or billion-dollar investments which were planned decades ago and introduced in rolling waves until certain priceless areas became unrecognizable. It now contains very, very little architectural or cultural continuity. You need to research the bits you want to see, (Duolun Road? Past intellectual centre and old movie theatre-cafe? ? It's a long way from Huai Hai Road!) and if you are serious, give it plenty of time. Some old trees still line Xiangyang Rd and Jianguo West Rd. Lovely shady trees also in some parts of Yueyang Rd. Avoid getting sidetracked into every coffee shop or mall you see; if it's very hot, that's difficult. Only a few, very small stretches have still got authentic bits of connected architecture which are genuinely photogenic, though you can have plenty of serious fun with a camera anyway. (Don't aim in people's faces!) If you want to see and eat, killing two birds with one stone, try a few famous spots: the Okura Garden Hotel (Maomin Rd) for buffet lunches or dinners (5 star prices), with the magnificent rooms of the old French Officer's Club and their lovely garden (by Huai Hai Rd, use Shanxi Nan Rd Subway Lines 1 and 10). Be warned that the Okura Garden Hotel's Rose Cafe saves money by using 'Avocet' (palm oil-base) instead of real cream or evaporated milk; this does not embarrass them. Their lobby is magnificent and the prices match. Opposite to them is the wonderful old JinJiang Hotel complex, and interior garden. Or try Citizen Cafe, Jinxian Rd by Shanxi Nan Rd, or Sichuan Citizen in Donghu Rd (many dishes which are not too spicy, as well as the hot ones). Try the delicious Shibata 'celebrity' coffee and cake shop in Jiashan Rd, near Jianguo West Rd (next to the Pines supermarket). Too crowded to get a table there on weekends; that happens a lot here! Take water, take a camera but don't let it dominate your life. There is MUCH more in the French Concession! It really depends how serious you are. And yes, Yongjia Rd has some cute cafes, too, and the newish La Cava delicious Tapas bar. . See if you can find the Song Fang tea house.

Although there are some large stores full of luxury goods, there are streets lined with interesting and unusual clothing, books and gifts. The restaurants range from Western (Italian, Mexican, Mr. Pancake) to Asian (Japanese, Thai) to a wide variety of Chinese, from high end dining rooms to food fairs where you can find noodles and dumplings. There are lots of alleys to wander through and watch the day to day Shanghai lifestyle. I recommend that you pick out a few key streets, shops, historical sights or restaurants from a guidebook, and use these to give direction to a day experiencing this neighborhood.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

I am, every year when I come back for the past 10+ years. there is always something new, exiting, chic, well-appointed, fun .. that you won't find in NYC, Paris, Berlin, Milano, Rome, Venice, London, HK, Tokyo. it is 1) beautiful .. most streets are cozy lanes lined with dense canopy of these \"French\" trees (possibly sycamore? I am not sure but I see them all the time in Provence and Italy) 2) completely walkable .. it is like Paris (where I have walked all over every time I go), streets are cozy and pretty, lined up with some of most chic, creative, unique boutique stores. 3) filled with cafes, restaurants where most staff speak basic English. you'll find anything you palate desires .......down to earth chinese tapas, best hamburgers, pasta, pizza, to IPAs. 4) I love window shopping in Paris because of the decor, the interior design, and window display. but it is safe and fair to day SH nowadays beats Paris out of water. if you are the kind that appreciates great merchandising and design (which I do), come to SH, esp French concession, you'll see some of the best examples in the world. 5) filled with people from all over. you'd hear French, German more often than chinese sometimes. French concession, actually city of SH overall, is a prime example how far China has come along, and what I would like to see the majority of China to become ... needless to say, SH is NOT China.
