In the evening, an endless parade of boats was navigating the river. I watched from the promenade, which has lots of people on it but is so large it was not overcrowded. There are coffee shops nearby. In the park by the promenade, there are many giant statues and artwork. The skyline across the river is almost all newer skyscrapers, including buildings with nicknames like the bottle opener and the syringe. On the other side of the river, there is the late 19th/early 20th-century architecture, including art deco buildings. At night, the buildings light up magnificently and it is quite a show.

Many of the buildings on the Bund have great historical significance, it is worth reading up a bit about the more prominent buildings, you will appreciate it better. There are two ways you can see the Bund: you can walk at street level or you can walk on the elevated promenade across the road. I had the time, so I did both. You need to walk at street level to read the plaques on many of the buildings, and to get a real feel for the place. But, if you walk on the promenade you can get a good overall view, and a bonus is the view of the other side of the river, the fantastic new buildings which look good in daytime, but even better at night. Plenty of places to eat, and there are many benches for you to rest if you need a break. Quite an experience. One amazing thing: whereas I was looking back at the old buildings from the elevated promenade, and taking countless photos, and video clips, the local tourists (the majority were young couples) were mostly looking towards the other side of the river towards the amazing buildings, which represented the new China! Hardly ANY of the youngsters were looking back, much less photographing the ancient historic buildings of the Bund! Emblematic of the new China I suppose! Oh, by the way, if you have time explore the huge monument at one end of the Bund.

I recommend that you go to this place in the afternoon when it is not yet crowded and you can still stroll and take good pictures of the skylines. I also highly recommend that you take the river cruise at night. It was one of the highlight of our trip! Along the street of the Bund, are the 1930’s Neo- classical buildings that are considered a national heritage. These interesting buildings are mostly occupied now by hotels and banks.

The Bund is about 10 mins walk from the station. A nice place to stroll along, taking in the nice city view across the river (with its vertigo inducing buildings), people watch and to admire the historical buildings on this side of the river. Pity for a lack of street food vendors to spice up the walk. Took the sightseeing tunnel to the other side of the river for 90rmb, packaged with a visit to the oriental pearl tower at 180rmb. Those who wants to head the the airport may want to take a one way trip at 70rmb as the walk back to the tunnel from the various sights can be quite a distance.

It is the iconic skyline view of Shanghai city, where you simultaneously see the colonial history in the impressive 1900s architecture on the west bank, including the Peace Hotel, original HSBC bank headquarters, and the signature Customs House clock tower; and then look east across the river to the futuristic Pudong skyline, Shanghai's new financial district which miraculously grew out of the rice paddies just 30 years ago. Strolling along the river is nice, but i recommend going inside some of the old buildings to explore the restaurants and bars located upstairs above street level. Upstairs, you can get away from the crowds and enjoy the view while enjoying a nice drink/bite to eat. Many buildings, including 3 on the Bund (corner of Guangdong road and ZhongShan Dong Yi road), and 18 on the Bund (Nanjing road and Zhongshan Dong Yi road), house numerous restaurants and bars, both western and chinese cuisines. As expected in any high profile, well-touristed area with a view, the prices in these establishments are higher than average.

The walkway or boardwalk which stretches along the Bund side river is wide & pleasant to walk. On a nice day there are vendors & a variety of activity for the many tourists who visit the area.

There is also a statue of Mao Tse Tung, and part of the wall of the promenade is a \"living\" wall planted with flowers which give a very pleasing impression. It's a very good place to go during the day, but really comes alive after dark when the Bund buildings are lit up (until 10 pm) and the lights are on on the buildings in Pudong - a spectacular sight across the river, especially as they continuously vary over time.

There are interesting flower arrangements along parts of the wall. If you want a great view, go to the rooftop bar, Bar Rouge - arguably the best rooftop view. We had no cover charge. The drinks were expensive but worth it. I draw back for a single guy traveller was that I was continually harassed by women, and some men, offering their services.

Don't get me wrong during the day looking at the skyline means nothing for all the snog from pollution just covers the buildings and you can't tell the second tallest building in the world from the local corner shop so my advice don't visit the bund during the day as the views are shocking and all you can do is look at what looks like fog however during the night it's a different story!!! We were all so exited to see the skyline at night and the bund becomes like a party- full of life and full of people, the smog clears and the buildings become visible as the lights light up the whole sky in shanghai- THERE ARE SO MANY LIGHTS- the bund became my favourite place you can see everything and not only that you can catch transportation (bus, train, boat and even a underwater light tunnel) at the bund to see the lights from all parts of the river so if you go to china visit , visIT , VISIT but I recommend doing it during the evening when you see the best of shanghai ", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

The huangpu river flowing calmly divides the east and west. Visit the bund on a weekday evening for a romantic experience. Strolling around the place during the day is an equally beautiful experience, just mind the sun. The place is definitely crowded on weekends and is noisy. There are lot of international cafes and restaurants around the area (subway, Costa, Starbucks to name a few), so when hungry there is always food nearby. On the whole, a great place to visit and would highly recommend!! ", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

But be prepared for the crowds - day and night. During the holiday season, the Bund promenade can be almost unbearable. For the best photo opportunities, I suggest gettting there at dawn (5am to 7am) or any time after dark. Once the lights go off on the Pudong skyline (usually 10pm) things get quiet very fast. And a late night stroll on the Bund can be pleasant. BUT, be aware of scam artists day and night: boys and girls who will come up to you and ask in English to take their photograph (the giveaway is that their English is very good). Most Chinese visitors will not ask a foreign stranger to take a photograph. If they ask to take a photo WITH you then it might be fine, but if they ask you to take a picture of just them - keep walking. And if they ask you to join them for Chinese tea - run. It is a scam. Having said that, if you have your wits about you, the Bund is a wonderful place - magical, timeless and beautiful. Looking for a good place to take a shot of the Pudong skyline? Just in front of the Monument To The People's Heroes at the north end of the bend. Bottom line: one of the world's most dramatic skylines.

If you want the best of both worlds, take a cruise of the Huangpu River and you will be able to have a balance view of both river banks.
