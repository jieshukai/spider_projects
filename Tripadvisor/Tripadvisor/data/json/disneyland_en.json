I think the title say’s it all. As a former Disneyland employee I had high expectations or warm friendly service, highly organized staff and experiencing as slice of America in a distant land. After living in China for eight year I should have realized I would be slapped hard in the face that Chinese people don’t understand the Disney brand. It’s all started with downloading their app and purchasing tickets online. It was a birthday celebration so I went all out purchasing the concierge package. I should have read the fine print. First, Shanghai Disneyland is not close to downtown. It’s an 45 min or 1.5 hour subway depending where are staying in downtown. When arriving at the park and picking up my $286 passes (for two people) I was informed the special concierge pass did not include the entrance ticket fee. What! Plus I had to go to a different area away from the ticket center to pick up my concierge passes. So I had to fork out an additional 165$ (for two people.) After walking to the concierge location and picking up the tickets I was given a map with had written notes on where and what to see. Everything highlighted was nothing different than what a regular guest would see or do. The concierge pass was a total rip off. Disney sell the pass as “create your own story”. I did create my own story of being ripped off by the park. The park was ok, characters roped off with long lines, half way through Mickeys afternoon parade the music stoped working so the characters were dancing along as if it was a normal experience. The best three rides were “Splash mountain, Tron, and Pirates.” Unless your bucket list lists seeing all Disney theme parks, I would suggest passing on Disney Shanghai. Disneyland Shanghai is definitely not “The happiest place on earth.”", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

Tron was an amazing ride and I actually love the fact that I could purchase Fastpasses to almost every ride available in the park. The handful of rides we couldn't such as Jet Packs we rode first thing in the morning and we skipped the carrousel. So even though the lines were long we really never experienced a wait and we were able to pay to ride Tron three times which was our favorite ride. The water raft ride was the best raft ride I've ever been on and I enjoyed the Yeti animatronics and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride with it's new technology was amazing and so different from all the others I've ridden. Even rides like Peter Pan have upgraded technology and are like brand new experiences. There were so many new things here it was like visiting Disney for the first time with that initial rush of excitement you get. I have visited the American parks so many times it's been awhile since I've had that type of Disney rush and while I visited Hong Kong Disneyland for the first time on this same trip it didn't provide the level of excitement as Shanghai. The castle is the most beautiful of the castles I've seen and it has a cool walk thru that's also unique to this park. I also very much enjoyed the Tarzan show and the fireworks which we got reserved seating for by eating dinner at the restaurant in the castle (it was an extra cost). I felt like the food here was better than Hong Kong but not as good as the food in the California which is my favorite so far. Yes, it's true that people here crowd and push you more than other countries and I was shocked when I saw children using the bathroom in the middle of the sidewalk but still the beauty and expanse of the park, the ability to ride almost everything with a fastpass and the new technology still made this the most amazing experience.

While waiting in line, we've experienced heavy pushing and cutting. And they don't speak a word of english! They have no social awareness at all. The whole time, they were up against my butt. And if I didn't move, they would try to cut me. They were getting on my last nerve. Also, the park has a limited amount of rides. No space mtn, no thunder mtn, no splash mtn, no small world, no matterhorn, no haunted mansion. Nothing. And i'd say there are only two rides that are actually good. Tron and Pirates. But right when the park opens, prepare to be waiting and hour or more for the stupidest rides ever (like Winnie the Pooh). I guess the Chinese people there don't enjoy thrill rides at all.

Firstly, to make it clear, the place is not dirty as some reviews mentioned, it is actually quite clean with the army of cleaners present. Language barrier there is for foreign visitors, as most of the staff do not speak anything else other than Mandarin, but with the bulk of the visitors being locals, I guess they don't see the need to recruit many English or other languages speaking staff. It's no different from being in Tokyo where most people speak Japanese or in Switzerland, where French or German are mainly spoken, a visitor just have to learn to get by using hand signals and pointing at pictures in the guide booklets or pamphlets. Yes, the queues for rides are exceptionally long but the locals go around it by purchasing fast pass tickets from online agents, which depending on the price, could even include a tour guide for completing Disneyland Shanghai's rides in the shortest possible time. For my visit, the longest ride queuing time on a weekday was about 20 minutes. In comparison, the regular queues took as long as 2.5 hours. Although many complained about the prices of food and drinks, I find them comparable to other tourist attractions. Moreover, 60 yuan digital vouchers could be purchased online from Taobao to pay for meals that costs 80 yuan at the cash register. That represent a 25% discount for a good tasty meal with drinks included. I thought the Chinese are quite innovative and they find ways to go around rules in the most creative ways and in turn, facilitate visitors who are in the know to really enjoy Disneyland Shanghai in a most leisurely manner. Obviously, those who do not know will be disadvantaged. In comparison, Tokyo Disneyland where rules are strictly followed, the long queues often turn off people with lower patience threshold. Do note that unlike Disneyland Parks elsewhere, there's no \"Small, Small World\" ride in Disneyland Shanghai, but don't miss \"Pirates of the Carribean\", it's really enjoyable.

The VIP pass allows you to enter the \"Fast Pass\" line ONCE for each ride in the app. Not all rides are included, but the best are: Pirates of the Caribbean, TRON, PeterPan, Soaring, and more. We waited in a \"short\" line for Crystal Grotto and it took a sweltering one hour...not bad by the standards of this park, We were there on a weekday thank goodness. Food options are many, Toy Story land was cute and new, but not great. Pirates is SUPERB and I loved the extended Peter Pan ship ride. Quite entertaining. A colleague was fluent in Chinese so we didn't suffer from a language barrier, but didn't feel we needed to engage with park personnel for too many reasons. We managed to master the app, though it sounds like others here struggle. The Alice Queen of Hearts maze is beautiful and fun to walk through, plenty of photo ops. Beautiful details abound.

The crowd was manageable and some rides had no lines or short wait time all day. Others we had to plan and use fastpass for. I can't imagine going there on a \"busy\" day.

Maybe it was because the park was relatively empty, but any time I had adoubt and questioned any of them, if they couldn't answer they searched for someone who could.We didn't catch any big lines or had any problem using the Fastpass available in the park. If youhaven't previously downloaded the app, the are several stations in the park where you can getyour Fastpass, but only with a Chinese and English language option. As we are a family ofadults, the main attractions we went were Pirates of the Caribbean, Soaring and Tron. The firstone is an upgraded version of the same attraction in Orlando, Soaring was identical and Tron wasan amazing ride, especially in the first row, and I recommend choosing the single rider for thisride as the line is less than half the time of the other. As for the shows, the Parade was a mustwatch, while the pirate show was half the time a comedy show in Chinese. The Tarzan show hadreally great acrobats but, like the other show, it lacked the heart and family feeling of the showsseen in Orlando. The food in the park was expensive so we preferred to have dinner at theCheesecake Factory in Disneytown. We went there by the subway line 11, which begins at theHongqiao Railway Stations (lines 2 and 10) and it was almost empty both in the morning and atnight, so we went seated the whole 11 stations, I think, until the Hongqiao Sation.

We all enjoyed, but if we didn't have a kid, we would probably skip Winnie the Pooh, and Alice in Wonderland. The best was Pirates of the Caribbean (for adults), kids under 5 y.o. will be scared there I think. Read the rating for other attractions and choose wisely coz you'll definitely can't cover everything in one day because the queues are CRAZY - have to wait for 1 h or even 90 mins in some! Maybe you can also figure out how to get Fast pass coz it will definitely save your time. Anyway, you will definitely enjoy it!

I was so excited about coming to Shanghai and complete my visit to all 6 Disney parks around the world. I had such high hopes for this park, but it immediately started off terrible. When we got there, they had us walk about ½ mile of course to go around a bunch of building to get in line to go through security. It took 70 minutes to get through security. The entire time, people had no conscience about personal space and they had no issues cutting in front of you if there was more than 6 inches between you and the person in front of you. After an hour of waiting after that, we finally made it to the line to get in. This was another hour or so wait until they opened up another gate and people started shoving and pushing. There were people on the ground screaming as people were walking and running over them. It seriously looked like one of those black Friday videos if Walmart was handing out free computers to the first 100 people. The people in line didn’t care and were shoving. I had to leave the line because it was too much, and went immediately to customer service and asked to speak to a manager. They talked to us, printed our tickets, and put us in some type of VIP line or something, as there were only like 15-20 people in front of us and we were finally able to get. This was an incredibly horrible horrible horrible way to start the day. Luckily this was the worst part of the day, and it got better, but just from that short experience it why I gave this park 2 stars compared to every other park. The workers there during the process of getting into the park did not care that people were getting stepped on or that there was no room to move or breathe. Talk about a fire hazard. By far one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had at any theme park. We came back the next day, and I chose to not come in at park opening, but rather an hour and a half after opening, hoping that it wasn’t the same thing again (we had bought 2 day tickets). Luckily the 2nd day wasn’t near as back and we got through security and the 2nd line in less than 30 minutes and were able to enjoy the rest of our visit.

Food was generally ok with a lot of quick service options. Lines weren’t bad if you planned carefully. We were there during a weekday and not during any holidays. Fast passes go quick but can be obtained electronically through the parks app on the wifi (which could be temperamental). Also, we found around lunch, dinner and during parades lines really cleared out for certain attractions. Also, using the secondary entrance for hotel guests helped tick off several rides in the morning. We rode buzz and Tron within the first 20 minutes with no wait. The night show was only ok and people were just clamouring to get better views and holding up phones. Overall while guest behaviour could be different than North America, most were extremely nice and friendly. If you are in Shanghai and love Disney this is a different and fun experience.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/36/mickey-avenue.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/46/food.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/3d/pooh-ride.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/30/voyage-of-the-crystal.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/36/mickey-avenue.jpg", "path": "en\\14_44_2d_36_mickey-avenue.jpg", "checksum": "43aa8ed57c1f148dfd9bb38579489a2f"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/46/food.jpg", "path": "en\\14_44_2d_46_food.jpg", "checksum": "ee94ba8e0f02aa1020d0ec85904389ef"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/3d/pooh-ride.jpg", "path": "en\\14_44_2d_3d_pooh-ride.jpg", "checksum": "bb7bb0ba2ec155605aa2fc494e0990cd"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/14/44/2d/30/voyage-of-the-crystal.jpg", "path": "en\\14_44_2d_30_voyage-of-the-crystal.jpg", "checksum": "ff792b9d1135020c6cfd70765dbd2da7"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海迪士尼\\en\\14_44_2d_36_mickey-avenue.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\14_44_2d_46_food.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\14_44_2d_3d_pooh-ride.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\14_44_2d_30_voyage-of-the-crystal.jpg"]},

I stayed at Toy story with my family (have posted the reviews of the hotel separately) Shuttle from both resort or from hotels are readily available and that too with no extra charge. You can book your park tickets way in advance while booking the hotel or you can also buy the tickets from the hotel reception. As the park is quite far from the main Shanghai city (around an hour and a half drive) I strongly suggest staying closer to it. Coming to the Disneyland: The park was bigger than Japan's Tokyo Disney which we visited in the year 2015. Nice chain of restaurants just outside the park to relax and try few international cuisines after a day-long walk inside the park. Ther is a huge food court inside the park as well but better food options are just outside the park. If you love thrilling rides to pump up your adrenaline then this is one place you should not miss. If you want your family portraits with Mickey and Minnie then you might have to wait in long queues especially if you are visiting during weekends, try to visit during weekdays to avoid the crowd. Lots of theme park inside, boat rides & thrilling rides. Last but not the least don't miss the Sound & light show at around 8 pm (check the timings in the morning ) & The Mickey Parade.

Be sure to bring your passport because unlike any other theme park in the world you will be demanded to show it just to enter Disneyland (this is the main reason why the line entering the park takes so long).

The shows here are numerous and of the absolute best quality including the very best castle fireworks spectacular anywhere in the world. The attractions as well are top notch and very unique to Shanghai. I especially recommend Pirates of the Caribbean, Tron, and Soaring.

I have been to Disneyland several times, Disney World over ten times (my parents live near there) and to Disney Paris once (very familiar feeling). This is nothing like any of them. If you take public transit, be prepared for a long walk to the entrance. On the negative side, the park entrance itself is very confusing and clearly doesn't host many Americans so we were pointed in six different directions before getting where we needed to go. Luckily crowds weren't terrible and we finally got into the park. We picked up maps and the general design of hub and spokes is familiar enough. Circling around the park, the first land has a pirate theme. This is not your mother's Pirates of the Caribbean ride, though! It is well beyond that technically and immerses you in an IMAX type movie experience. We all felt the whole day was worth that one ride. Other than that lines were long (and there were lines to pick up fastpasses - not quite getting any benefit there). My daughter and friend waited two and a half hours for Tron (the sign said 90 minutes - another issue as most Disney parks overestimate the wait, not the reverse). They did say they loved it. Buzz Lightyear was the same ride but with upgraded technology which made it that much more fun.

Instead of 2 hour lines we were treated to walk-on for Pirates all day long and minimal waits for everything else. The park itself is large and beautiful - I didn't see much of the line-cutting that I had prepared myself for. The one thing is they definitely need to add additional rides - there was really just a handful. As a Disneyland/Disneyworld veteran Tron was an experience knowing it is headed to Orlando soon (and that is 3 years as defined by Disney). Fast passes act like the Disneyland MaxPass which I LOVE and it is free - no running around for paper stubs. The PhotoPass was reasonable - ~$30 which made me hate Disney World a little for ripping you off so badly for something that could be offered so cheaply. I would skip the Mine Ride with any type of line since it is underwhelming, identical to Orlando, and for some reason the most popular ride there. Likewise Soarin' is skippable for the same reason - the ending scene with the Shanghai fly-by being the only difference - outside the unique queue and Krofft-brother like introduction that put Patrick Warburton's to shame. They have a unique take on the Premium Mickey ice cream bars but no Dole Whips. I recommend queueing at least an hour early (they have turnstiles outside the park leading you to security - it seemed to open about 30 minutes before the park opened - then lines queued at the gates) Another tip - there was no 4G (I'm a Verizon customer) and the Disney wifi was spotty outside the gate so I had momentary panic that I wouldn't be able to open my Disney App to get to the tickets.

Supposed to be the happiest place on earth far from it in Shanghai. I am from the USA and not used to the culture there but people are rude, a lot of pushing and cutting the lines. In some of the rides like Winnie the Pooh there is a point where the gate is open which allows for random people to think they can just waltz in and cut the line. Well it happens bc no one says anything and they get away with it. The 2nd day we were trying to get into the line about 15 people just pushed themselves through a small space and formed another single file line in a space only wide for about 2 people! It's not like the USA where you can book your fast passes ahead of time. Because Shanghai is so flooded with thousands of people each day you can only book a fast pass one at a time and you have to get in line for that. Many of times the popular rides get sold out so there are no fast passes. It's a really messed up system at Disneyland Shanghai. It's hot and with so many people you really need a lot of patience. Disney town was pleasant bc there are not many people there. If you are thinking of visiting Disneyland Shanghai you probably only need one day bc you have to be willing to get frustrated and angry at all the long lines and the cutting and rude people. Not the happiest place on earth according to my opinion. We went in July 2017.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

First off, drop off for people arriving in private vehicles is about 1 km away from the main ticket gates. It was hard to find and a long walk across a bridge over the divided highway. We arrived at about 6:30 am and were in the line for security screening by 7am. Following the security screening, we got in line to get tickets and get into the park. We had purchased tickets online and had to show passport to get the tickets. Once we got the tickets, we searched for the premier pass line, which is sold on main street very close to guest services. The premier pass allows you to ride all the fast pass rides in the park a single time (tron, winnie the pooh, soaring over the horizon, peter pan, roaring rapids, seven dwarves mine train, buzz lightyear). Cost is $600 RMB per person for the set. It is worth it on very crowded days. Anytime you go to Disney in the Summer is a crowded day because the kids are out of school. We made it to Tron by 8am and rode in standby with a 15 minute wait. After we got out, the line was 1 hour long. We walked clockwise around the park hitting all the fast pass rides and jumping into shows and exhibits (star wars, marvel super heroes, pirates show) opportunistically. The pirates of the caribbean ride was a 60 minute wait and we did this one in the heat of the day....very draining. There is no fastpass for this ride. It is an amazing upgrade from the old pirates of the caribbean ride. We made it all the way around and went back to Tron with fastpass in hand. Ate dinner at 7pm in Disneytown.

Download the Disney apps, buy tickets online and keep the receipt. Arrive before 8am and avoid public holidays and the hotter months. Bring passport and ticket receipt with you. The first 20-30min as you meander your way from the transport drop off to entrance could be challenging due to the sea of people and miles of zigzagging fences. After the security checkpoint (don’t bring food or sharp objects), present your passport and ticket receipt to the staff at the turnstiles to redeem your tickets. Immediately after you’ve passed the turnstile, scan the QR quotes on the ticket with the Disney apps, then get your first set of fast pass (only one ride at a time). Consider buying premier pass for your favorite ride to avoid the (possible) 135min wait. The apps contains a mobile map and updates on show times and waiting times . The pirates stunt show and Tarzan shows are highly recommended. Our family enjoyed the Soaring Heights ride and Peter Pan rides. Tron also looks great but we were too scared to try. Try to have lunch before noon ahead of the crowds, and if you have younger kids do hire the stroller. The Alice in wonderland maze and the enchanted castle are great for the kids. We spent almost 12 hours in the park and enjoyed it very much.

First is yes you will see some cultural shocks when you visit the park. I did see a few little kids per in the line but honestly if line wait of 1-3hrs is the norm little kids will end up having to go. The other thing I have to comment on is the way most park visitors queue. Park entrance, 1.5hr wait to just get in, every children's ride at 1hr wait, exciting rides 2-3hr waits leaves a seasoned theme park visitor like me having to make decisions I usually would not do when visiting a park. I did more eating and shopping. Just as a fyi it was school holidays in Shanghai and each day was a sell out. The rides and shows are worth normal theme park wait times but I regularly saw the park app saying 210 minutes. This makes the ride a deminishing return as you truly loose a lot of your park day in lines. This negative experience is magnified by the desperation of the people in a queue. If there is any space in the line there will be a local filling it. So lines that normally would have up to 2 people taking up room from chain to chain you would regularly have 4-6 people crammed there. It made just getting into the park a real chore.

You have to wait for someone to return with a key after they've been on the ride. There are about 50 lockers and what felt like 3000 people in line. A joke! Then when finally in a line for the actual ride outside, there is a line inside that you go through too where we saw the actual ride and that seats were not being filled up! Infuriating to say the least. The park as a whole was missing that Disney magic and the excitment thats in the air at other parks I've been too. I saw one character out and about, but most likely because there was always a sea of people everywhere. I was really disappointed with this place. Crowd control and limited daily entry numbers is required for a better experience. Sad to say this about a Disney park but I felt a day of precious holiday time was wasted here.

So not a peak season and on Wednesday. It was incredibly crowded!!! I have never ever seen so many people in an amusement park before! And don’t forget that mostly there were Chinese people, so rude, unfriendly and with no manners at all. Maybe, just maybe, Disney should try not to make all the money in the world and limit amount of tickets per day, so people can actually have fun, but it probably won’t happen, so... I was determined to have a great day for myself, which i did, here are my two cents. I liked the one in Florida better, but this one is not all bad. First of all, you have to be mentally prepared to be pushed THE WHOLE AND ENTIRE day. Remember: manners are out in China. The funniest thing is even if you start to push, you are still not as good at it as them. Which is actually a grace for us. So just shut mentally down. First line will be to enter the Disney, the bags will be checked and they confiscated my Sun Screen (it was a spray, so take cream instead). Second: do download the APP, otherwise you are lost! Do it before, at home or hotel. Third (which is not for everyone but you might want to think about it): the moment you enter the park, get yourself a premier access. Costs unfortunately around 80€ or 90$ but otherwise i don’t know what you’re going to do there! At a non-peak season middle of the week day the lines were 70-180 (!!!) minutes! 180!!! You are just gonna waste your time. Forth: do NOT eat in park itself. Go to Disney town (you can re-enter the park with your ticket but the bag will be checked in order to find food/drinks), there are a lot of options there including (thank god) the Cheesecake Factory. Fifth: if you want to buy anything (although i have to say merchandise is catered for the Chinese taste), don’t do it in the park. Too many people in there, again being pushy and the stores are way too small. Again, go to downtown Disney, there is a huge store with everything you can find in the park minus the crowds. Or even better yet, in the Bund area there is a Disney store too, with different merchandise but way cheaper and convenient. So all in all: i managed to make the most of my day, with premier access you get fast pass to 6 or 7 attractions, that doesn’t completely eliminate waiting, but i managed to visit other attractions i wanted, had a dinner at Cheesecake Factory and bought souvenirs. Pirates of The Caribbean is absolutely stunning, i liked it a lot!!! Otherwise be prepared to wait up to 170 minutes each time. Maybe you’ll be able to ride 3 times... Unfortunately...

Up to 4 (yes FOUR) hour for the good rides after maybe 10am, One of our kids went on a good one as soon as we arrived and waited maybe 30 minutes. This quickly blew out to 2 hours. Assuming profitability they need to invest in more rides or restrict the amount of people they let in. For example, there is a canoe paddle \"ride\" which was only a 90 minute wait. The reason it takes so long is there are only 3 canoes where I reckon they could easily accommodate 6. Such a shame as the park is new, clean and reasonably well organised.

Well the experience was not as we imagined and we regret a lot for getting our daughter there! The place was so crowded, clearly with more people that it could bear! Immense queues to get in the entertainments, waiting time ranging between 120 and 180 min! We couldn't tolerate such long waiting time, we felted not respected at all. The food was also of a very low standard and expensive! In the food court near Tron I tried the worst burger I have ever tasted! Why not have MacDonald's or Burger King doing the professional work? Clearly the goal of Disney Shanghai is to put as many people as they can inside to maximize their profit not caring about the quality of their service or even for people's safety! Two hours standing in a queue with kids? Is this the respect that Disney pays to their customers? That was a very bad joke! How many entertainments we could get in one day waiting such as long time? This was the far most outrageous situation that I had ever faced in a theme park before. And I never could imagine finding it at Disneyland! I felt so sad for disappointing my daughter and completed cheated for have paid for a service that I haven't had. It was a sunny day and the place was so crowded with so many people with umbrellas bumping you around that we decided to leave by 4 pm before have an eye punctured.

The Tarzan show is also a must as it is a mini cirque style production with highflying acrobatics. We considered the park a pretty good value at about $350 RMB each which is about $58 USD.

The lines are over two hours long each for most of the popular attractions (I went for two days midweek), I suggest arriving before park opening as when you enter there were people running to the fast pass machines. Given that fast passes run out within an hour of ride opening for Soaring and Roaring Rapids I can understand why. The shows were acrobatic based and fun although translations by headset or surtitles like other Disney parks would have been very welcome. There were many incidences of line jumping and this caused a large number of arguments. There were a large number of touts and hawker's selling Disney items that were definitely not Disney employees. Given the really long security lines I can only assume that staff are being bribed to allow entry as all bags are checked. I also went for a character breakfast at Lumier's Kitchen where I only had photos with three characters the food was generally good except for the hash browns which were inedible. This is the only Disney I would not recommend to visit, the rides are fun and the park beautiful but the park is simply not up to Disney standards and is the worst equipped for foreign guests. I can understand why this park is so popular given the difficulty of Chinese tourists to get travel visas to visit other parks but for everyone else avoid at least until Disney make more rides and exercise better standards at the park.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

Then after getting through the first gate (like going into a prison) and onto the next one for ticket check, about the same time. An hour standing before we even got in. When you are both fairly hefty, as we are, you can easily block the line to prevent people pushing in. When people were finally released into the Park most of them sprinted away towards the rides, and for the first 30 minutes or so all there was were people running in all directions, even pushing strollers at great speed, I'm surprised the tyres were not screaming. I saw the line for Fast Track passes for the first of the rides we thought we would try ‘Soaring over the Horizon’, it was huge. But we queued for only half an hour for that ride and it was well worth seeing, a sort of iMax movie from chairs which moved around. I really enjoyed it. We then headed to the ‘Pirate of the Caribbean’ ride and the single rider line was only 30 minutes. It was a water ride with CG movie, very, very well done and good fun (though in Chinese). The third ride which D wanted to try, and was prepared to wait 3 hours for, he said, was the ‘Tron Lightcycle power run’ –only a 10 minute wait at mid-morning. You need to stow your bags in a free locker on the way in (locked with a PIN) Anyway that ride made me decide that I would never go on another roller coaster. Crouched forward, as on a motor-bike, but securely wedged in, it reaches speeds up to 97 km/h - no wonder I felt nauseous. But I guess I’m glad I tried it.

Pirates is an attraction that mixes screens and traditional set pieces with a unique ride system. Tron is a super cool launched coaster that combines awesome lighting and light techno. While they are the two best, it seems Soarin' and Roaring Rapids get higher waits. Soarin' is exactly the same as its American counterparts. So I would not waste your time there if you have been or plan on going to one of the American ones. Raging Rapids is a fun raft ride, which I would suggest getting a Fastpass early for. Tron and Pirates have single rider lines, which can help reduce the wait there. Other than that, Challenge Trails, Buzz Lightyear, and (especially) Peter Pan are rides that deserve a look. Buzz and Pan are much better than their sister attractions around the world. If you're pressed for time, I would skip Pooh, Jetpacks, and Seven Dwarfs. Yes, crowds are a concern.

As a Disney fanatic the expectations were really high, I was hoping for a similar experience to the parks in America. However, I found myself quite disappointed. The whole experience was pretty good, it was an enjoyable day out. But there were a few things that caught our attention. When we went to buy tickets, they asked us for our passports. We didn't know we had to bring them because it was not noted on the website, so we ended up having a full security check. When we entered the park, the staff seemed quite afraid to interact with foreigners which really changed the tone of the day. The biggest thing for me was that it was extremely difficult to find anyone to speak English. Granted, it is a park in China, but it is also Disney; an internationally acclaimed magical brand. The rides and the shows were all in Mandarin with no options for English version, not even headphones.

It took a long time to get into the park, and when we arrived (one hour after opening) all fast passes were sold out and average wait times were 1.5 hours! We went on two rides, Pirates and Tron, watched the parade (which was great!) and walked around the park to soak Up the sights. Tron was a thrilling ride, but the wait time was an estimated 130 minutes...we found it was closer to three hours before we got on the ride. You wait and wait and finally are sent to a line that takes you into a room with a glass wall, the wall become transparent and you can see the other riders taking off! Great, we thought! We are getting on the ride finally!!! Wrong, you leave this room only to line up for another 45 minutes! Ugh. But the ride is really smooth and fun! Before Tron we caught the parade, and finished Tron at 8pm, in time for the fireworks!! Park was supposed to be open u til 10pm with fireworks at 8:30...wrong again, apparently the park closing time has something to do with the number of folks visiting, and this night they closed at 8pm and had moved the fireworks to 6pm without notice (we missed them as we were in line for Tron at this time). I heard the night before they closed the park at 7:30. So keep this in mind, and maybe ask around a lot about park closing time. Also be prepared to wait, and get In line well before opening to be one of the first In the park to get the fast passes, they are handed out and gone very quickly. Food is really expensive, so bring in your own food. It is allowed (as are water bottles) the picnic area was packed with people bringing their own food. Your bags are checked at least once, maybe twice security is tight here.

Afterwards waited 30min. for the main entrance (we had online tickets so saved time). First we've tried Adventure Isle but all the fastpass was finished! Unbelievable!!! It was 10:00am :( Due to high queue (150min.) skipped Soaring and waited 65min. for the Pirates of Caribbean (quite good).Around mid-day had only one activity! Luckily found fast pass for Buzz to 5pm. Had lunch at Pinocchio Villa (pizza was ok).Spent 90min. for Peter Pan (only good for children).Afterwards used fastpass (finally!!) for Buzz lazer ride (fun).Finally waited for Tron ride.Used single ride which saved 1 hour as we skipped all the line inside and ride in 1 hour. During all the time Soaring and Roaring had always around 165-195min. waiting time. So waiting time for star events are 2 to 3 hours!!! The park was full although it is Friday.People are naturally rude unfortunately and they also make the park dirty. After Tron ride, had burger at Stargazer Grill's (disgusting-please avoid). Our day ended up with Ignite the Dream at 8:30pm near the castle which was amazing. Overall very very long queues,disrespectful people,bad food with very high price.

We arrived early, before the park opened. I purchased the tickets online which definitely saved time with queuing. It was mid week on a Wednesday and the weather forecast was cloudy with possible showers (most Chinese do not like the rain so a rainy day is a good day to go. Also most won't take the children out of school so term time is also a good time). Metro was easy, line 11 directly there. We had time to get a Starbucks coffee and muffin in Disney town just to the left of the entrance gate. Once the park was opened we headed straight for the Tron ride which was not disappointing. There were no queues so we went on it twice. The frozen show was good and although it was in Chinese it was easy to follow what was happening. The Tarzan show was great, super acrobatics. I have to say the audience although visibly enjoyed the show, didn't give much of an applause so if you go give the performers a big round of applause because they really are fantastic. I really can't find anything bad to say about the place..toilets were clean, no litter, friendly staff...i think our Mickey ears showed the staff we had entered into the spirit so we got lots of waves and smiles. I think previous bad reviews may have been just to the huge numbers when it first opened and the usual teething problems of any new attraction. If you like Disney (I've been to Disney in Florida, LA and Paris) and you go with some fun friends and family then you will love it! I'd definitely go again the next time I am in Shanghai. Ps download the Disney App as its brilliant for getting around the park.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

And to our surprise there're weren't much people at the park that day. So the weather and the temperature is the key to the crowd in the park. We only took 2 fast passes, one for Soaring Over The Horizon and Tron, we started with Pirates of The Caribbean as it had a 15 minute wait, all of the rides that day were within 20-40 minutes and that includes Mine Train as well, we waited for 30 minutes without a fast pass for that ride. However, Soaring Over The Horizon had a 60 minute wait so we got a fast pass first thing when we got in the park, however, we couldn't see what the fuss was about, it was just a 3 minute long widescreen show of famous places in the world. In my opinion, I don't recommend people to wait for over an hour on a low crowd day(or at any day) for the ride. Totally not worth it. I downloaded the Disney Resort App beforehand and it helped me check all the wait times in the park. However, we wanted to go through the park anti-clockwise, so we kinda left Tron for the last. But it had a 10 minute wait all day! When it came to the time where we wanted to get on the Tron ride, it was closed down for refurbishment. And we only had 2 hours left for the day! That was a disappointment, but we went on other rides and I constantly kept myself updated on the ride in hopes of it opening up again. And after two rides, it opened up, with only 30 minutes till the fireworks. We were glad as there weren't much people still that time, and we got to ride it twice! One tiny problem that got us stuck for a while is that if you have a bag or any personal belongings that are unfit for the ride, you have to prepare yourself ¥1 coins for the lockers. If you don't have any like me and are only left with big ¥100 notes, you can easily change them at the Tron store behind the locker area. Don't go buying the lockers for 3 hours! Lastly, we didn't have fireworks, we had animation projected on the castle. It was amazing! If you've been to Osaka Castle in Japan, it is similar to the night show on the Osaka Castle, just less animated. Great overall and the castle was definitely extremely pretty, take more pictures of it as it is definitely breathtaking!(especially at night)", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

{"username": "827morganp", "user_loc": "马萨诸塞波士顿", "bubble": "20", "add_time": "2017年7月15日", "title": "Didn't feel like Disney", "content": "We are pretty big Disney fans - I've been to all of the other Disney parks around the world, we were married in Disney World, my family owns DVC, my father-in-law works for Disney, and we are WDW annual pass holders during some years... We're not so into the characters or movies, but more the service level, thoughtfulness, technology, and attention to detail we've come to expect from Disney. Visiting this park was not the purpose of our trip, but we ended up in Shanghai as part of three weeks in Asia, so we knew we had to stop in! Having said that, this was by far the worst Disney experience I've had. It didn't have the Disney feel at all. Wait times were minimum 200 minutes+ per ride when we arrived (this can happen at WDW too, but I've never seen it that bad for every single ride with the exception of Christmas week). We were planning to buy the Fastpass package anyway, but it was sold out. We visited on a Monday. I hate to say that we were appalled by the Chinese tourists, but it was terrible. We've all seen people get a bit edgy and selfish at any theme park, but this was crazy. The pushing and shoving, yelling, spitting, and smoking cigarettes in queues was baffling. There were also people - regular guests - walking up and down INSIDE the queues selling fake Disney merchandise (e.g. light-up toys, keychains, etc.). The first time it happened to us, I stared at the person in shock and she interpreted it as my interest to purchase something from her, then proceeded to continue harassing us. You're stuck in a queue, so it's not like you can get away from the person. This would never fly back home. There seemed to be no cast members around - the complete opposite of U.S. Disney parks where they are everywhere! The few cast members that we did encounter - like the ones checking our tickets at the entrance - were so rude. No smiles, no greeting, etc. I was worried that it was because we're American, but as I observed many others going through the turnstiles, realized it was just toward everyone. We did ride and love Tron - we waited about 2 hours to ride it, and there are lockers where you must put your belongings (can't bring any bags on the ride). There was a wait for the lockers! There weren't enough, so we had to keep running around trying different stations and get into the spirit of pushing and shoving to try to get a spot. In line for the ride, if you stand single file, people will push past you. My husband and I had to form a wall in order keep our place. When you turn a corner in a queue, there's extra space, and people will take advantage of that to move past. If I had read this without visiting, I would think this sounds crazy, but it really was exhausting to have to be on the defense for two hours. We were so excited that we did ride Tron, though, figuring that was the one big thing we could experience there and not here, and then came home to the news that it'll be coming to the Magic Kingdom :). Oh well. The food was mediocre, and honestly because the park was so big and spread out, a bit hard to find. You definitely had to go looking for it - not like at home where it seems to be everywhere. We were hoping to make a reservation for dinner before our trip, but were told they were only available for character meals, which we're not really into. The fireworks/laser show were also mediocre, and again - there's just not much respect for others when trying to watch any show there. We stopped in the World of Disney store on the way out, but couldn't find one item that said Shanghai Disney on it! We were hoping for a souvenir but couldn't come up with anything. I will say that the tickets were cheap by U.S. standards - we paid $54.34 per ticket for a one-day pass. They were easy to purchase on the app, and you can just go straight to the turnstiles with the phone ticket - no need to stop at a will-call booth. We took a taxi to and from our hotel in Downtown Shanghai, and that was easy too.

There are only a few good rides: Pirates, Tron and 7 dwarfs. All others are pretty much typical and ordinary. Was wowed by Pirates though! The pirate stunt show was cheesy until the actual 5 mins of stunts. The skydiving action was amazing! The Tarzan show was a great incorporation of traditional Asian acrobatic feats set to African backgrounds. Both of these shows are worth watching even if you don't speak mandarin. Christmas wasn't as played up as I thought, but the tree was nice.

The day at the park was a great day. We had dinner in the Downtown Disney area which is great. They even have a little Cheesecake Factory. We ate at the Thai Restaurant which was excellent and very reasonably priced. That is the other thing, people who think things are cheap in China are incorrect. You can buy the typical trinkets and bargain in the markets, but we spent time reviewing prices in the department stores and their prices for the same TVs we have or washers dryers fridges blenders etc. are equal or more in price.

That locker wait can take as long as the ride wait, so you may be better off finding a set of lockers for another close area rather than using the official ride lockers.

Yes, it's still completely Disney and the Chinese influence is subtle, but it is there for those who look for it.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/36/tron-ride-entrance-shanghai.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/39/star-wars-shanghai-disney.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/1f/tomorrowland-shanghai.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/42/winnie-the-pooh-shanghai.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/36/tron-ride-entrance-shanghai.jpg", "path": "en\\0f_60_0f_36_tron-ride-entrance-shanghai.jpg", "checksum": "dbd85936c039848cb8af365dba75d5ef"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/39/star-wars-shanghai-disney.jpg", "path": "en\\0f_60_0f_39_star-wars-shanghai-disney.jpg", "checksum": "7e3e97099c790a2dfbf6414c7c7b9f8e"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/1f/tomorrowland-shanghai.jpg", "path": "en\\0f_60_0f_1f_tomorrowland-shanghai.jpg", "checksum": "10d827925cca38289d69d7b1df26c3ba"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/60/0f/42/winnie-the-pooh-shanghai.jpg", "path": "en\\0f_60_0f_42_winnie-the-pooh-shanghai.jpg", "checksum": "e8f6c1788ad5eb3d276e87d981f26213"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0f_60_0f_36_tron-ride-entrance-shanghai.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0f_60_0f_39_star-wars-shanghai-disney.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0f_60_0f_1f_tomorrowland-shanghai.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0f_60_0f_42_winnie-the-pooh-shanghai.jpg"]},

Arrived just before 8am in order to 'beat the queues'. The park is lovely and designed in true Disney fashion. We went straight to Tomorrow Land to go on the Tron ride which was AMAZING. By 9am we'd been on Tron twice and the Buzz Lightyear ride...unfortunately after this point the park was rammed! We queued for the Pirates of the Caribbean for about 40 minutes (worth it though as it was the most brilliant digital multimedia simulator)...after that rides were almost impossible to get on without an hour queue. The problem here was that the fast pass queues were almost as long as the rides themselves. Disney's fast pass system here just doesn't work and we became quite frustrated. That said we visited the Wolfgang Puck restaurant in the Disneytown area (accessible by leaving the park) for an early lunch and we're pleased that the meal cost about half of a similar Puck restaurant in Downtown Disney restaurant in Florida. As a family we're seasoned Disney park visitors and Disney Shanghai was good and I'm sure will expand and become great! ", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

There were people in the line, who offers poncho for half price! Police was throwing them out, but they were coming back. For new and unique rides check out \"THRON Lightcycle Power Run\" it is very cool and different from other rollercoasters. And we also loved \"Challenge Trails at Camp Discovery\".

The fact that we can make this assessment tells you that we have actually been to every Disney in the world. It doesn’t tell you that we have been to Disney Paris more than 40 times (we lived in Paris) or that we went to Hong Kong Disney more than 30 times (we lived in Hong Kong) or that we spend at least 1 week a year at Walt Disney World (vacation house there). So while I never really expected to find myself being able to say this, we are pretty well versed in the Disney Parks. Each park has something special and unique about it to recommend it: some parks are better for certain age groups, some are better due to proximity to other attractions, etc. etc. Walt Disney World has been sort of the pinnacle of the Disney Park experience, mainly due to size, scope and organization. But Shanghai Disney runs a close second, at least for our family, for the following 5 reasons. ", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

You can get a lot of rides in early, while most of the visitors are up front fighting to get selfies by the castle. ", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

By arriving early and with a plan we were able to see pretty much every major attraction in the park with a max wait time of maybe 30 minutes. We did however skip Roaring Rapids and Buzz. Biggest complaint is the Fastpass system, if you arrive super early it is helpful to pick up FP for either Soaring or Roaring Rapids, otherwise they are all gone within 30 minutes of opening and >120 min wait. We later spent 40 minutes in line for FP in fantasyland which was a total waste of time in the heat as we had already ridden the only 3 FP attractions offered in the area with minimal waits. Also not impressed with the food, overpriced, crowded, not very good quality and minimal table-service offerings (though we could have gone out to Disneytown).

I would advise to go early, get a fast pass for either soaring or the raging river, and line up as early as possible for the other one of the bunch. Tron- the fastest ride, is put up to even higher speeds during night time, and fast pass tickets run out quickly, so be sure to get them as early as possible.

Still planning on Tokyo Disneyland. Disney World in Florida is by far the best with it's amazing wrist band access to your hotel room, entry to the Parks, payments for purchases, meals and Fast Pass. Be sure to bring CY money with you when you visit Shanghai Disneyland, as most of their retail stores and food courts will not take credit or debit cards unless they are from China. Only exception is the actually Disney retail store and the two Disney hotels (Toy Story & Shanghai Disneyland). Weekends are extremely busy with long lines for everything! You can purchase a Fast Pass for $60 Canadian dollars when the free ones are gone, not sure how many they hand out but it was a shock to me to purchase a Fast Pass from Disney staff. Since this will be my only visit, I purchased the Fast Pass to Soaring which was the new one showing in Disney World. It's not quite Disney as while many things look similar, they have different policies. No one lines up and it's so crowded that it's difficult to walk. While they rent you wheelchairs (my father needs one), it very difficult to maneuver with the crowds and the slopes within the park. The Wolfgang Puck, Cheese Cake Factory and Starbucks really do taste the same as in the USA. Although, Starbucks have made additions to their teas and pastry to include Chinese appetite and were quite delicious.

Granted, I have not been to a Disneyland park in several years, so I am not sure how things have changed if at all. Pirates of the Caribbean is visually amazing! Through parts of it, the boat you're on is going backwards, which makes it interesting, but just like most of the rides, it's not long enough for my taste. Oh, and all dialog is in Mandarin, but it's not hard to understand what's going on, it's just amusing to hear the beloved characters speaking Chinese. Peter Pan, The Seven Dwarfs Mine, Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and the castle are all very well done and super cute! TRON is awesome! It's like you're inside the video game and the lightcycle coaster is super fast (Again, I just wish it had lasted longer!) which makes for great pics! With Disney's acquisition of the Star Wars franchise comes a Star Wars exhibit, small and out-of-the-way which was a bit surprising, but we did meet Vader!! Hope they do more with this, they could make it an awesome experience!! Roaring Rapids was closed for scheduled maintenance and had I checked the website I would have known, but I wonder why it was scheduled for a Saturday?? When I visit a Disney park, I will not go during peak seasons, holidays, or other times that may draw larger than normal crowds. I did not need fast passes, the lines for those were too long anyway, and I'm happy to report that the wait time for each attraction we went to (which was pretty much all of them) was not that bad (even Pirates and TRON), and the lines actually moved along just fine. The Parade was good...Disney knows how to do it right! The 8:00pm fireworks show was more of a fireworks/light/laser show, as fireworks are now apparently illegal in Shanghai, but I guess Disney has the ok for some. It was a fun show to watch, highly recommended, especially if you have kids...they will love it. Back to what's missing: Splash Mt...what we thought was Splash Mt. is a ropes course. Fun, but we really wanted the log ride. Space Mt...it's just not there. Haunted Mansion...I was really bummed about this. No Matterhorn. It's a Small World...really??? Yep...not there either. Really hoping these are in the works. The cast members were all very nice and helpful, some language barriers at times if you're not from China, but still very helpful. The park was easy to get to on the metro system but the metro closes by 10:00 or 10:30pm (even on weekends) so watch your time. The food was not great, but the carmel corn was really good. Even if you live in China and enjoy the food, which I do, I didn't care for the food at this park. All in all, it was fun and we got through it all in one day. As I said though, I hope they add more to it in coming years. I give it a '4' because although we were disappointed in the lack of some things which we were looking forward to, Pirates and TRON totally redeemed the park's shortcomings!", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/a4/ad/32/darth-vader.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/0e/a4/ad/14/me-and-winnie-the-pooh.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/a4/ad/20/me-and-mickey-mouse.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/a4/ad/08/tron-lightcycle-coaster.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/a4/ad/32/darth-vader.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_a4_ad_32_darth-vader.jpg", "checksum": "cd15e381dea2b6304931fb64353bf119"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/0e/a4/ad/14/me-and-winnie-the-pooh.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_a4_ad_14_me-and-winnie-the-pooh.jpg", "checksum": "99e5d4e45a57c3316e507daa4e8f7522"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/a4/ad/20/me-and-mickey-mouse.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_a4_ad_20_me-and-mickey-mouse.jpg", "checksum": "6d36048d2f196296dd1566d2dbd205e5"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/a4/ad/08/tron-lightcycle-coaster.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_a4_ad_08_tron-lightcycle-coaster.jpg", "checksum": "b1a33b44f940cce07db31d32c03c6373"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_a4_ad_32_darth-vader.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_a4_ad_14_me-and-winnie-the-pooh.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_a4_ad_20_me-and-mickey-mouse.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_a4_ad_08_tron-lightcycle-coaster.jpg"]},

I know Disneyland quality and the Disney environment. I love everything Disney. I do not know about some of the positive reviews on here, but here is my honest experience. Amazing infrastructure, beautiful park, Tron is new and different; love the A/C in restrooms and the Star Wars/Marvel/Mickey meet places have no wait and are very cool (China just not into some American icons yet). The price is a bargain, but really too low only 500 yuan about $75 dollars. This issues Disney can control - more signage, huge park easily get lost/confused; more staff in the field (numerous staff in the stores selling stuff, best to assist customers in the park). Issues they can try to minimize; smoking (could not see the smoking areas signs, but seems like the whole park, many people smoking. Black market on fast passes, massive rush of people to get fast past and sell them for 300 yuan at the local bathrooms. There is a whole network on non-traditional Disney customers in the park only for the purpose to make money. Cutting in line, yes I know the culture differences, but it is so obvious and local Chinese Disney employees do not stop it or even mention it. Most popular is coming in through emergency exit and my child/parent/cousin etc.. is in front of me and I just trying to find them. Sleeping beauty castle, so beautiful outside - inside a mass of people squatting, sleeping eating non-Disney food (the image of train station comes to mind). Disney employee hide inside of fancy restaurants in the castle. Solution - double the admission price (sorry), hire more staff for park, enforce no-smoking, line behavior and eliminate the obvious black market. I left after four hours, the non-chinese disney staff asking the family in really good chinese to please not stand in the flower bed and have a seat in the bench in front of them - they refused and actually laughed.

After debating if it was going to be too hot for a day walking round a theme park we decided to buy our tickets online the day before.. However the website was not taking international cards so we had to get a friend in China to buy the tickets for us.. Would have been annoying if we didn't know someone who could get us the tickets. We got the subway from the bund area to the Disney resort, only cost us £1.50 for 2 people- this was a great start to the day. We arrived at 9am and it took us until 9:15 to get through the security line and ticket check. The day had already started to heat up so we headed straight for tron. Luckily the queue was inside and air-conditioned. Really great ride with a seating concept I hadn't seen anywhere else.

I've endured long waits at Shanghai airport occasionally, but never anything like this. The lines were good training for the experience inside though. Even a simple 'canoe experience' (sitting for ten minutes in a canoe with twenty or so other people while holding a paddle) had a 75 minute line. When I went to the bathroom I went through a gate into 'Disneytown' and needed my entry ticket to get back in. We were with five of us. My girlfriend had held the five tickets but gave each of us a ticket back after we entered. Turns out I had my daughter's ticket. When you enter, I found out, a picture is taken and then stored attached to the ticket. I could not see I had my daughter's ticket, but they could see it. They could of course also see on their computer that I had entered at the same time and they could see my picture. I also had receipts from a purchase inside the park. But could I get back into the park? \"No. Wrong ticket. Procedure. Let me explain to you sir. For your safety. For everybody's safety.\" When I walked through the gate anyway, they tried to physically block me, but I kept circling and I walked on smiling anyway, inviting them to follow along. I had no other option, my phone was out and I had arranged to meet everybody at 5pm at a cafeteria across from 'the flying elephants'. One manager (Mr. Travis) and a security guard followed me all the way to the cafeteria where I had arranged to meet the family. Then they complained they had to wait so long (cause the lines are so long the family did not arrive at 5). Then they called a senior manager (Mr. Jonathan). He called more security after trying to explain to me that he understood what had happened with the ticket, but that procedure was the important thing. In the end there were six security guys and two managers surrounding happy little me, sipping hot chocolate, insisting I needed to go to 'guest services'. But I just refused, meaning they'd have to take my chocolate drink and carry me. Luckily China is a very non-violent country, especially if you remain kind and reasonable and smile happily. I don't blame those security guys of course. But management of this place needs some serious re-education. No wonder the lines are so long. All the security guys are busy surrounding innocent elderly foreign visitors sipping hot chocolate. Finally the family appeared. The idea was still that we should go to guest services to get my ticket looked at by the machine, but by now management had lost its enthusiasm for pursuit of idiocy and just wished all of use much additional enjoyment. Jonathan even took our picture.

It is a world class Disney park. They have figured out the Chinese culture as far as public cleanliness habits and challenges waiting in line, and have everything well managed. The bathrooms are spotless, and have warm water, soap and hot dryers. The attractions are different and unusual (conpared to Tokyo Disney - which I am familiar with since I live in Tokyo) My daughter thinkgs it is to be senitive to the current political issues. For example, there is no haunted mansion. The TRON ride is the most popular but the lines were over 3 hours and the fast passes were gone. We enjoyed the Pirates of the Carribean ride, which is much different than the others parks we have been to. Very multi media and exciting. We didn't eat at the restaurants, since we wanted to see the entire park, and it is pretty big. WE had carmel corn from a kiosk which was deliciious. Also a tea smoked duck leg and some chinese beef wraps. The castle is beautiful, and they have added central asian architectual features. It seems so big when you are in the park! Also, Mulan is a big feature at this park. She is in the parade riding her horse, and it is very cool in a stylized chinese way. There are many restaurants in DisneyTown which is technically part of the park , but serves alcohol. Think California Pizza kitchen and Wolfgang Puck. Very surreal. It was interesting comparing features with the other Disney parks. There were very few other foreign tourists, so we did attract attention, but everyone was very friendly and polite.

As with all Disney Parks the night time spectacular is a stand out feature.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/07/7e/41/snowwhite.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/07/7e/5e/treasure-cove.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/07/7e/8e/gardens-of-imagination.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/0e/07/7e/7b/suitcase-and-a-dream.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/07/7e/41/snowwhite.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_07_7e_41_snowwhite.jpg", "checksum": "e8138d65b8a28c7fcdee1680799c61f4"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/07/7e/5e/treasure-cove.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_07_7e_5e_treasure-cove.jpg", "checksum": "26f7043984c02f6b7c011d553d126733"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0e/07/7e/8e/gardens-of-imagination.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_07_7e_8e_gardens-of-imagination.jpg", "checksum": "0532b49891bd65a9961e99e9e0fd337d"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/0e/07/7e/7b/suitcase-and-a-dream.jpg", "path": "en\\0e_07_7e_7b_suitcase-and-a-dream.jpg", "checksum": "5e25f66c31f9d3c72d9c0f03e2b0f7f2"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_07_7e_41_snowwhite.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_07_7e_5e_treasure-cove.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_07_7e_8e_gardens-of-imagination.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0e_07_7e_7b_suitcase-and-a-dream.jpg"]},

Didn't encounter any uncouth, spitting, loud, unruly behavior, shoving the people are famous for. During the parade, the locals make way for my boy to be at the front so he could see and enjoy the show. Q for the rides were super long but in orderly fashion. My teenage daughter went for the special 1 rider Q and was quite fast. Toilets are dry and CLEAN. There's one HALAL stall at Disneytown @Food Republic - Yershari Rstn which was never highlighted offering 2 diff kind of fried rice, sate & soup. taste was descent. Surprisingly there's a stall offering Malay Nasi Padang but no halal sign. Overall will give Shanghai DISNEYLAND a thumb up. Go & experience for yourself to believe the happy place in Shanghai.

We had been anticipating it days before. I had read so many negative reports regarding the park's cleanliness issue and the unruly people pissing somewhere \"convenient\". However, surprisingly, the park is clean. People are smoking only on designated areas. I never saw one taking their \"CR break\" anywhere. Their staff are always picking up every piece of trash, even just a piece of leaf that had just fallen off a branch. It's not as big as what I've expected but it sure was tiring to roam around the whole day. But even if it was just my 1st time on a Disneyland theme park, being a Disney fan I would say the magical feeling when I set foot there is quite lacking. The architecture sure is marvelous as well as the castle especially at night with the help of the lighting and Christmas decors but I can't help but feel like the magic is absent. Despite this, the TRON ride was exhilirating. The interiors are so futuristic. We were also looking forward to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride but unfortunately for us it was temporarily closed as well as the Roaring Rapids. The highlight for me would be the fireworks. Somehow I felt like the magic that was missing kind of compensated by the fireworks show. During winter, they close at 7 pm. I hope they close at a later time though. Nevertheless, we will back for sure. We are actually contemplating on purchasing their Sunday seasonal pass for 825 RMB valid until March 31st.

", "content": "I had previously read some bad reviews about Shanghai Disneyland and was skeptical when I decided to go there. Some people said staff was rude, didn't smile at all and didn't speak English. I don't know if I was lucky, but I had a great experience there. Staff was very friendly with me and my friend whenever we needed help finding some places and whenever they could not speak English, they smiled and called another staff. The park was surprisingly clean and I did not see people throwing rubbish on the ground or smoking there, apart from the smoking areas. Getting a ticket at the park was pretty easy and there was not many people on that Saturday. Also getting a fast pass wasn't difficult at all and took us not more than 5 mins in the queue. Just as an advice, I'd recommend you taking the \"single ride\" queues wherever available, as there are very few people in these queues, even less than in the fast pass ones. The only thing is that you won't sit beside your friend or family, as you will be filling \"empty spaces\" in the rides. I'd strongly recommend going in the Tron ride. This is the only park that has this ride. It goes super fast but it is not that scary as it seems to be from outside. Dining or even snacks there can be pretty expensive if you are on a budget, so you'd better bring a sandwich in your bag.

{"username": "JackR46", "user_loc": "", "bubble": "50", "add_time": "2016年11月1日", "title": "Some tips for maximum positive park experience --", "content": "A few hints from a Disneyland season ticket holder for over 15 years and has visited every single Disney resort park worldwide. To get the most out of your visit to Shanghai Disneyland: (1) if possible, avoid Chinese holidays and weekends.(2) purchase tickets ahead of time online (3) arrive at park entrance one hour before official opening time. This early in the morning It takes about 20 minutes to get through security and about 20 minutes to get through the entrance gates. Once inside the park, you cannot go further into the park than the first major intersection of Mickey Ave. It is roped off there. The rope barriers were dropped from 15 minutes before (on one day) or at the \"official opening time\" (the other two days). (4) Have a plan - which way you want to go first - to the left for Tron or to the right for pirates and soaring - either to get fast passes or get in line for these most popular attractions.(5) The later in the day you arrive - the longer the lines, less (or no) availability of fast passes and the more crowded it gets (6) after doing Tron, Pirates and Soaring, then the rest of your day can be based on wait-times of rides you are considering, available fast passes, your specific interests, etc. (7)The evening fireworks, laser and animated projection show onto the front of the castle is definitely worth seeing. However if you are in the front of the castle area, be prepared for a mass chaos of people crowding into areas where there's no room for them among people who have already tried to establish their territory. You can get great photos of the castle projections from here, but the show is not very enjoyable due to the overcrowding. We watched it twice in the park. But our favorite time, was the third time when we viewed the show after our dinner, sitting at our table on the outdoor terrace of Wolfgang Puck's in Disney Town overlooking the Park. Generalizations - Park guests seem to be at least 99% Chinese, so there are definitely cultural differences! Also, little English is spoken or even understood by cast members. But some English is spoken by leads and management. No, or minimal English during the shows - or even \"subtitled translations\". Tarzan show is basically a Chinese Acrobat performance and is very enjoyable without any translation necessary.The Pirate stunt show - the first part drags but once into the theater, the great set and stunts don't need translation. Even when other rides and attractions are very busy, Star Wars Launch Bay and Character Interaction, Marvel Universe, and the Alice in Wonderland Maze are almost vacant and definitely worth a visit,If time & space permitted. I could go on & on, but I think you have the idea. Other than the Disney characters, the themed rides, the overall \"Disney\" atmosphere and some of the attractions themselves, your experience here may feel very different than in any other Disney park, with the possible exception of Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is a much smaller, more intimate park and English is understood by more of the cast members - possibly from their history of being a British colony for so many years. We have been to HKD twice - once when it first opened and it was not very crowded at all, and we really enjoyed it. Then again last year, when it was much more crowded, but we also had a good time. As far as your trip to Shanghai Disneyland Resort - do a little research, figure out which rides or attractions will be your priority, go with an open mind and you'll be fine.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/5d/peter-pan-ride.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/44/projection-show.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/53/mulan-float-in-paraade.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/65/pirates-of-caribbean.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/5d/peter-pan-ride.jpg", "path": "en\\0d_7b_18_5d_peter-pan-ride.jpg", "checksum": "0e83324f3d0c26df06c349473b093415"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/44/projection-show.jpg", "path": "en\\0d_7b_18_44_projection-show.jpg", "checksum": "86f8c8a5b25cd88af4626e35c05c355a"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/53/mulan-float-in-paraade.jpg", "path": "en\\0d_7b_18_53_mulan-float-in-paraade.jpg", "checksum": "ea0ba0edb825053b098a98b5495754ec"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0d/7b/18/65/pirates-of-caribbean.jpg", "path": "en\\0d_7b_18_65_pirates-of-caribbean.jpg", "checksum": "23880574dd468afa8be40d7694533438"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0d_7b_18_5d_peter-pan-ride.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0d_7b_18_44_projection-show.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0d_7b_18_53_mulan-float-in-paraade.jpg", "images_上海迪士尼\\en\\0d_7b_18_65_pirates-of-caribbean.jpg"]},

We rode it twice with less than ten minutes wait!! Pirates of the Caribbean we had only 10 minute wait too. The staff kept the lines moving quickly which was great. If you want to eat, go to DisneyTown - some great restaurants out there with a variety of cuisines. We also tried the caramel popcorn - it was warm and so delicious. A fantastic day!

Another highlight was Buzz Light Year, Adventures of Pooh, Pinocchio and Peter Pan. My favorite of them all was the Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure (GREAT Ride) and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train with the cars only pivoted front and back. We missed Soarin and Camp Discovery. Like all other Asian Parks - use the Fast Passes as much as possible. For shows, the Story of Tarzan was very entertaining, the Golden Fairytale Fanfare in front of the Castle shows must of the Princesses but the one to see is the evening show on the Castle - Ignite the Dream- a Nighttime Spectacular. Be sure to find a spot early and be ready to keep it. Food was good - did a lot of pointing. Yuans preferred, credit cards accepted. Tip: try to hit some of the good rides late.

We were so excited to be able to get to the brand new Disneyland in Shanghai. It was so much fun, because basically it was new to everyone there. We loved the Tron ride. Only went on it once because it was too long of a wait for the short ride. Our very favorite ride was the Pirates of the Caribbean. Wow it is nothing like the other Pirates of the Caribbean rides. We went on it 4 times and could have gone more times. They don't have a lot of rides, but it looks like they have room to grow. The workers were so excited and very friendly. The castle is very big and beautiful. We went to the Eye of the Storm show. It is \"Captain Jack's Stunk Spectacular\" show. Even though we could not understand what they were saying it was very good. In the stores they are selling a lot of things for their Grand Opening. So we had to buy many things for us and to bring home to family and friends. It will be fun to return in a few years to see how it has changed and what they will have added. Only one thing we found bad there.
