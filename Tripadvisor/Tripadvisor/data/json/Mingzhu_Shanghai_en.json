We did not purchase the ticket to the Tower at the Puxi ticketing counter as we were told that the queue was 2 hours long and we didn't want to waste time queuing. After we exited from the tunnel and walked to Tower, it was indeed very crowded but there were a couple of young men representing Ctrip, standing near the ticket counter offering the Tower visit packages for 300 Yuan per person, inclusive of special entry passes that bypasses the 2 hour long queues. Decided to fork out the money for the packages since we were already there. Once we entered the Tower premises through a separate entrance, we indeed saw snaking queues with no end in sight. So, it was true that queues to go up the Tower would take 2 hours in the line. We took a ride up in a elevator up to take in the sights of Shanghai from the upper observation deck. The massive crowd in the observation deck that Sunday just doesn't allowed a view of the city to be taken at a leisurely pace. A walk down a central staircase led us to the glass floor sky deck and again, it is crowded with many people taking pictures of their friends lying down or sitting on the glass floor, causing obstructions to others who just wanted to walk by. I guessed that due to either a lack of maintenance or the scuffing of a million shoes on the glass floor, the transparency of the glass floor and clarity of the view below were affected, as such, it wasn't that scary looking down from that height. Anyway, was the 300 yuan per person trip worth it?

The museum takes us back to those times allowing us to observe how the city was shaped over a period of the past 200 years.

We took the advice of the hotel and went in the morning, unfortunately not early enough so our \"short wait\" in the lines was close to 2 hours. I could see the qu's lines could have been a lot longer. Be prepared for airport security, not once but twice within half hour of each other. Once you go through that line, then you have lines for the elevators. Try keeping your luggage down, make sure liquids, scissors or small knives. Wear comfortable clothes and most of all have a good attitude because it really is a nice overall experience. Plan on spending 4 hours here-- there is lots to see and just enjoy. As others have said the transparent deck is a must to see, take selfies and just enjoy the people enjoying looking down. I went on a cloudy day, it still was fun and I could see the city. Have a snack, make the time spent in lines worth the wait. There are some games to be played, a VR roller coaster, couple of corny movies, and lots of Chinese people watching.

The view of the tower from the outside is fabulous and makes great photographs, but the queue even for tickets was horrendous so we decided to return on a weekday. We opted for the sightseeing ticket that included the space capsule 'right at the top' because of this we were ushered into the longest slowest queue and couldn't understand why the other queue moved so fast, especially when we all joined the same lifts! We queued for over 1 hour to get to the lift only to find it was broken and were then ushered into the other queue that had moved so quickly to reach the same initial floor. From there you have to find and queue for the space capsule lift. On reaching the space capsule we were so underwhelmed and frustrated. If you like white plastic you will have reached heaven! Awful, tacky and disappointing. We queued again to come down and then bypassed the hoards of people on the observation deck down the steps to the glass floor deck. We enjoyed this deck and so grateful otherwise the whole experience would have been poor. My advice is not to pay the extra, go with the basic entry, avoid the longest slowest queue and head straight for the glass floor deck.

{"username": "jamgypsy", "user_loc": "", "bubble": "40", "add_time": "2017年3月8日", "title": "Hope for a Clear Day and Have Patience!", "content": "The Oriental Pearl Radio and TV Tower is the signature image of the Pudong side of the Huangpu River in Shanghai. Most Shanghai tourists will go see it and take pictures; some will spend the ticket price and the time to go up in the tower and see the views. I have done both. This time I was primarily interested in the Shanghai History Museum at the base (which is well worth a lengthy visit, by the way) but figured I'd do the whole tower since I had the day to explore. When I tried to enter the museum first, I was redirected back outside to the tower entrance--apparently the route is one-way (as is often the case in Chinese crowd control). I was overjoyed to see hardly a line to get in--but that joy faded as I realized how slowly the short line was moving to feed people into the elevators to the top. It was about an hour's wait to enter an elevator, which was only the first of several in the process. If you are claustrophobic, do NOT try to go up in the tower as we were crammed tightly body against body at several points. Finally I reached the upper observation tower and the view was truly wonderful. Although not a perfectly clear day (do those exist in China?), it was clear enough to see a long, long way and I understood why Shanghai's inner city is the most populated in the world. You can walk completely around the viewing area and spend as long as you want. To reach the \"space module\" (an additional fee had been charged) or topmost sphere, we waited again in line for a much smaller elevator and put on shoe covers. I suggest you do NOT waste your money and time on this part! It was just a space designed roughly to resemble the inside of a futuristic space ship (think Star Trek) and seemed to me to be very dated. The tower was built in 1994 (over 20 years ago) but the ambience of this level reminded me of 1960's concepts. There were two large interactive computer screens but one was out of service and the other was monopolized by kids. Even the view was not as good since windows were small and had poor visibility. However, in contrast, the lower observation platform was very exciting! There is an exterior glass-floored viewing area that the brave could walk, sit and pose for pictures on. This area is not fully enclosed so you get the winds which were biting that day but added to the drama. Of course most people crowded near the access point on the calmer side, so walking around to the less crowded windier side gave me more space and time to get up my nerve to creep out on the glass floor. There is a small snack shop at this level and I tried some popcorn (which in China is sweet, not salty). I did not want to pay the highest ticket price which included the buffet lunch since reviews of the restaurant were poor--and I'm not sure I would have even made it in time due to the wait. (Perhaps there is a separate, faster line for restaurant patrons?). On the way down, it was unclear how the exit lines worked (yes, another slow line) so I somehow missed being able to visit some other exhibits at a lower level, but since I still wanted to visit the museum, I didn't mind. I ended up back at exactly the same entrance to the museum I had first tried--but this time I was granted access. The museum features many scenes with wax figures of traditional life in the Shanghai area with other exhibits on up through period of the international settlements. I did not see anything from the mid-1900's on, which was part of my interest; nevertheless, I thought the museum was well designed and very interesting for all ages. Children would love the tower, too, but may have difficulty with the long waits that may be incurred. Plan plenty of time to explore the Oriental Pearl.

The views from the top are very nice though I have to admit - having been on dozens of observations decks and overlooks over the years - that I probably don't get as thrilled as I used to by paying money to go to the top of a building to look down. It's like looking out of the window of a landing jet for the hundredth time: you notice how tiny the buildings are and you notice how the little moving cars look like toys, and then you go back to your book. Putting that aside, the views are very nice, even to me, and likely are really super very nice to others. Who doesn't like looking down on things? Anyhow, one level below the top is the observation deck with a 5\"-or-so wide glass-bottomed rim and everybody scrambles to sit or lay down to have their picture taken with the city below them. (Note: Over half of the Chinese tourists visiting the Pearl Tower were using selfie-sticks, not just \"correctly\" but also to wiggle their phone in front of others, or to just to poke them.) After taking the elevator back down (which includes another wait that wasn't very long for us but could, I imagine, be a drag on a busy day), you begin a trek through dozens of shops, others attractions, food stalls, etc., that add five minutes or more to your effort to simply leave; again, not a major hassle, but a curiously Western gauntlet of product placement overkill.

The buffet is an experience mainly because of the sights, with a variety of good foods, although seafood is almost all frozen, but again, you are here for the sights, on the revolving restaurant. The ascend further up is rather for those who do not have sea-motion sickness.

It was my first time there, and it was RUBBISH. The windows were too high for the kids to see out of; too white and glary for us to see out of properly; no better view than the lower platforms; and there was an extra 30 mins wait for the additional elevator to get up there (and a line up to get back down to the main 'globe'). The only advantage of the RMB220 ticket is that you get to line up in a shorter queue down at the bottom (so it would have been an advantage to purchase this ticket and then 'get off' in the main globe). The best part of the experience is the glass-bottomed viewing deck down on the 259m floor (walk down the stairs from the main globe).

It is cool to go up into an icon of the contemporary Shanghai skyline and if the weather is good, i.e. No pollution or fog, the view is also very cool. Do check the weather advisory before deciding v to go up, as you will disappointed if visibility is poor or nil. The Hyatt does not sell tickets when visibility is poor, but I am not sure of the Pearl's policy. However, if you are claustrophobic, impatient, or do not like crowds, it is not the place for you.

They just waved me off and kept telling me over and over they were the towers tourist information only and refused to speak any English. I was getting desperate for help as time was ticking. I pressed them and pressed them for information and asked them how they could possibly service English speaking customers if they did not speak English. After almost 3-5 minutes of pressing the staff for an answer, one of them finally said 'it is out the door and to the right'. If this is the customer service at the information center downstairs from the three pearl viewing platforms, why would I bother going back as I had originally planned. What a complete bummer.

Once inside, go to the all-glass “Skydeck” observation platform located in the tower’s second sphere structure which is 290 meters above the ground level - it is amazing!!!!!!!

The building and skyscrapers were never ending! Try make sure you go on a clear enough day so you can see everything, thats my only tip! There is a floor that is glass where you can walk out onto it.

You will have to buy your ticket in advance to avoid the long line at the ticket office. But there is still a long line once you get past the gate inside the tower. It is like going to Disneyland where the line just stand still, so have lots of patience and be ready to feel cramp because everyone will be trying to get ahead of you. Everyone just want to get to the top of the tower. But once you get to the top, the view is fantastic. You can see miles away and also there is the glass floor which you is all the way around the tower and you will be able to walk on it if you are not afraid of heights. So on the ticket you have the option to purchase ticket for the tower or the tower and lunch which rotates around while you are sitting down to eat. If this is your first time I recommend to purchase the ticket for the tower and lunch combo. You will not regret it and also you can relax and enjoy the view while eating. Allocate at least about 3 1/2 hours because you will not be able to get up the tower, check out the view and the attraction around it and then come back down. In summary, this is one of the must attraction beside the other sightseeing attraction which I will post later.

Very hard nowadays to get near it for FREE photos; it seems to depend on the crowds, as this is a HUGE favourite with out-of-town Chinese, visiting their own Big (APPLE?), well, the big Pearl. Locals are very proud of this structure, which scintillates variously at night, pulsating with a lot of pink and purple. Of course, it's just another Tower, quite high prices to access different levels, and the usual 'food outlet' spinning slowly around, at the top. Is it worth it? The nearest subway is Line 2, Lu Zha Zhui, hard to say and easy to confuse with Line 1 (red line) of Xu Jia Hui, which is totally different... Hahah. Write it down. The subway is ferociously jammed in working peak hours, and on much of the weekend. Beware pickpockets, naturally. Line 2 is the green one which also stretches to the 2 airports.

My wife and I only had a Saturday available for our visit, so I was a bit concerned about the crowds we might encounter. We went around 5 PM and surprisingly the wait was less than 30 minutes (we did not purchase tickets to go all the way to the top, which had a much longer queue - most folks here on TA mention to avoid this anyway). The queues at the bottom of the tower were well managed and moved quickly. However, the queues to get DOWN were an absolute nightmare!!! For such a major attraction, the management of the queue area at the top was a complete disgrace! People pushing and shoving in from all directions while being herded like cattle. We had a local tour guide during our 2 week trip in China that mentioned the mainland Chinese are now learning to queue - I wonder if he has ever been to the top of the Pearl Tower. Honestly, if I had a children with me I would be very concerned with their safety. We did eat the buffet dinner at the revolving restaurant which was surprisingly good and reasonable. Although we had a one hour wait, it was not a wait in a queue so we had plenty of time to enjoy the views on the two decks (as a bonus, due to dinner, we got to enjoy the views during the day and at night). My advice is to avoid a weekend if possible and have your elbow ready to fight for those elevators on the way down!", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

The Pearl structure is amazing. Below the highest observation deck you can walk down to the see through platform. It is scary to walk on but pictures are great. Young people love it.

I have been to the tower once back in 2006. It is located on the Pudong district (across The Bund, separated by Huangpu River). If you stay nearby Nanjing Road area, it will take about 20-25 minutes by taxi. The Oriental Pearl Tower is not really strategically located. Usually the taxi driver will drop you off in front of IFC and you have to walk about 10 minutes to the tower. Getting a taxi from there is also a bit difficult. The entrance ticket is a little bit expensive for a tower like that. They will charge you RMB 160 (approx USD 25) to go up to the middle level. If you wish to go to the top, you have to pay RMB 220 (USD 35). There is actually nothing inside the tower (except for shops located on the ground level). It is only famous because you can see the Shanghai landmark from the tower (depending on the weather). You can dine in too, and you will be charged RMB 970 (USD 160). Although I'm not sure if the price included the food and beverages or not. There is an outdoor scenic area (but I don't recommend the outdoor scenic area if you're afraid of height). Going down is very confusing and inefficient. There are two ways to go to the ground level. From the 263m, you can go directly to the ground level by lift (but most of the time this exit is closed) or you could go to the 250m by stair, then you go down to the 90m by lift. And once you're on the 90m level you have to go through an indoor (kind of) amusement park and go down again by stairs. Once you go down by stairs you have to take another lift (a see through lift) down to the ground level. It's an iconic landmark in Shanghai so it's understandable if people would love to visit the tower. But for me personally there is nothing special about it.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

At the very top is the smallest, the Space Pad, for which there is an additional charge to visit. The middle sphere contains a large revolving restaurant and bar, as well as several shops, and steps leading down one level to a gigantic sight-seeing deck. This is as far as you get with a regular ticket. The lowest sphere contains the so-called Space City, a fantastically conjectural glimpse into the urban future. Astonishingly, the tower contains only 14 stories, widely separated, so that they appear to be strung out as on a beaded necklace ---- a considerable waste of elevation, but then it was built primarily as a Radio and TV hub, and other utilities were probably an afterthought. One of them is a boutique hotel that occupies 5 small spheres at ground level, while other attractions such as the City of Science and the Shanghai Municipal History Museum ( that we had no time to visit) are also incorporated into the complex. So many towers of this kind that draw visitors because of the spectacular views they offer, require submission to intolerably long waiting times because of the limitations of vertical transport. Not here, where there are as many as 6 elevators each of which can hold 50 persons, and the speed of ascent is 21 ft per second that still allows time for an explanatory commentary on the way up.

First thing to do is see the museum on the ground floor. This was one of the best under-rated museums we have seen and there was so much to see including wax figurines of life in Shanghai around the turn of the century. Give yourself a good 45 minutes to do this properly - it was great. We went to 2 viewing platforms including the glass floor level. Make sure you get this this level during the day because at night the floor loses some of its transparency. The buffet dinner in the revolving restaurant was good but not great with food running out quickly. It was very dark to ensure maximum views of Shanghai at night - most of the time, you couldn't see what you were eating. Drinks were an extra charge, we brought our own. The views were just stunning in the evening. Get to the restaurant when dinner opens at 5pm to get the best seats, the window seats fill quickly.

From our hotel, it was a quick 3 stops on the subway. We were proud of ourselves for navigating the morning rush/crowds underground. Once we got there, we were able to walk right up to the ticket booth to get tickets. We just purchased the observation level tickets which was the cheapest price. We went inside and again, no lines! We got right on the elevator to the top observation floor. There were glass windows around the entire circular path. It was a relatively clear day because the rain cleared out some of the smog the day before. The views were incredible and it was amazing to see how large Shanghai really is. There were some really cheap souvenirs for sale at this level. Then, we went down a floor to another observation area with a glass floor. They were replacing some of the floor glass on one side, so we could only go around half of the ball. At first it was a little daunting to walk out and see straight down with nothing but a pane of glass preventing you from falling to an untimely death. But, if you aren't afraid of heights, it makes for a really cool picture. We then went down another level with a metal gated observation deck. If you have a tight grip, you can hold your camera/phone out through the gate to take pictures with an unobstructed view. While going down, you also pass through an arcade like area and I think they have a kids roller coaster? We then took a glass elevator back down to the bottom. Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience in Shanghai. I would highly recommend it, especially if you can go right when it opens so that you can beat all of the crowds.

It's an excellent investment in your time, but this whole place needs to be avoided like the plague in the peak holiday times, when lines stretch around the whole of the inside of the tower just to get into the TWO elevators to the viewing floors (well over an hour from entrance to elevator in early July 2013 - seriously painful experience with lots of rude, impatient nationals in the line, and on viewing floors, where there were also long waits from elevator to viewing areas). There are alternate high rise viewing destinations in Pudong now, but the Old Shanghai experience is a one and only at the Pearl!", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/04/aa/b6/2e/old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/04/aa/b6/2c/old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/04/aa/b6/2d/old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/04/aa/b6/2e/old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "path": "en\\04_aa_b6_2e_old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "checksum": "2225871ff163c7c8efe42284f519c41c"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/04/aa/b6/2c/old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "path": "en\\04_aa_b6_2c_old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "checksum": "f0e50a22590ad59f4863f4948ea81369"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/04/aa/b6/2d/old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "path": "en\\04_aa_b6_2d_old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "checksum": "88c8f48274032a290db6e2de01250829"}], "image_paths": ["images_东方明珠\\en\\04_aa_b6_2e_old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "images_东方明珠\\en\\04_aa_b6_2c_old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg", "images_东方明珠\\en\\04_aa_b6_2d_old-shanghai-museum-pearl.jpg"]},

On the way down the tower, there is a roller coaster ride, very short but also very cheap.... good fun! When you exit the lift at the bottom of the tower, you are in a restaurant area .. we can recommend the pizza place, they were great and were only 58 yuan for a 9\" pizza. But don't order the potato chips unless you want potato crisps! (we were expecting hot chips/fries) There is a metro station nearby, or you can take the tunnel back to the Bund area.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/02/ee/e8/6c/oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/02/ee/e8/3e/oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/02/ee/e8/7a/oriental-pearl-tower.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/02/ee/e8/6c/oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "path": "en\\02_ee_e8_6c_oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "checksum": "21c6d891b77556f088678622f0cd0032"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/02/ee/e8/3e/oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "path": "en\\02_ee_e8_3e_oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "checksum": "075e5bf314a9d70ee56e5d758cdfa944"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/02/ee/e8/7a/oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "path": "en\\02_ee_e8_7a_oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "checksum": "df75ed7ff110e7fece4caf358ac08352"}], "image_paths": ["images_东方明珠\\en\\02_ee_e8_6c_oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "images_东方明珠\\en\\02_ee_e8_3e_oriental-pearl-tower.jpg", "images_东方明珠\\en\\02_ee_e8_7a_oriental-pearl-tower.jpg"]},
