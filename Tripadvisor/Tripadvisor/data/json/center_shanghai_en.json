It was very clean. You get a 360 degree view. BE AWARE that one of the floors for viewing wasn't ready yet when I arrived so I felt I paid for something I couldn't access...also the mall advertised in the building wasn't yet open, when I say open I mean the shops weren't yet ready! The website doesn't say this nor the leaflet/brochure you get on arrival. Having said that I had a great morning,", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

If you decide to go early, heads up - a lot of your groups hit this first. I was sandwiched between four large groups. The ticket purchasing process was organized chaos but I didn’t have to wait more than 20 minutes to get mine. Price is 180rmb. Some of the staff speak English too. There is a brief show prior to taking the elevator up. You’ll be lead to a waiting area with two lifts and four lines. The wait isn’t long and there is a counter on the ceiling indicating the lift’s location. The top has stunning views although I’m sure the best time would be early evening to see the lights. Pollution is thick and can obstruct views. The glass walkway is not for the faint of heart by the way. There is an opportunity to have your photo taken professionally for 50rmb but it’s just the pic. You can spend as much time as you’d like but it will get crowded.

Wasn't sure how cool it would be. Answer, it was way cool. I live in Shanghai, and my family was coming in town. We took them to the 100th floor with the glass floor. The line was pretty bad the first time we drove by (about a 2-3 hr wait on this particular weekend), so we came back the next day and the line wasn't bad at all. Had to wait about 30 minutes. Kids under 1 meter are free if I remember correctly, and between 1-1.4 meters get a discount. The pictures were a lot of fun up at the top. The glass walkway is actually kind of freaky and fun. It's currently the tallest observation deck in the world (guessing the new Shanghai tower will soon end that). Make sure you go on a day with no clouds and without really bad pollution or the view across the whole city will be severely diminished.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

The 100th floor houses the sky bridge, and it is from here that you get the most unobstructed views of all Shanghai. I started my tour around 5pm, and was ushered first to the 100th floor. Expecting to be pushed out of the floor quickly I began to line up to take the elevator down and then realized that there were others who came up with me that were still hanging around. So, I decided to take a chance and squatted (like many others) by the glass. That was the best decision on this tour. Apparently, no one asks you to leave until you want to (ofcourse 11pm is the cut-off). I first had a good view during the day (although it was cloudy and visibility was not all that good) and then the lights came on. That changed the view completely.

Located in the Pudong side of the river, one can reach this place either using the line no: 2 on the metro or by road on a taxi or local bus. One will have to get off at the Lujiazui metro station and walk a couple of blocks to reach this building. You will pass the Oriental Pearl TV tower and the Shanghai mall on your way to this place. For a 150 RMB price tag, its pretty awesome to be reach the tallest observation deck in the world. They have 3 levels which they take you to, one by one on this super awesome elevator, which has this effect of very high speeds owing to the lighting effect inside. Once up on the 1st observation deck one can have a look around and above as there are transparent glass inserts on the ceiling too.

It is quite good but for a five star view head to the Bottle Opener! Cannot miss it because it really looks like an old fashioned bottle opener. It is a little pricey to get to the top but totally worth it. The first step out of the elevator on the110st floor is a little scary as the floor is glass but after a minute ortwo it is an awesome experience. I watched little Chinese girls about 5 years old laying on the glass and giggling as they looked down 100 floors to the ground and I hung on to the walls until I was ready to be brave and walk freely. I am not afraid of heights but my husband is and he very wisely stayed on the ground. It took me about an hour but he happily spent time in one of the many coffee shops, restaurants and or wine bars below the tower. Very accessible from the metro, do not bother with a taxi.

Then drop down to the 91st floor bar for another, before decending to the 87 floor restaurant where the views are better because you are only looking through a single pane of glass. I found it easier to get a window side table in the smokers restaurant. Your first three beers will cost you about the same as the entrance ticket to the observation deck!!", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/b4/66/4b/looking-down-on-the-bund.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/01/b4/66/4e/dont-go-up-when-its-cloudy.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/b4/66/49/looking-down-on-the-jin.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/b4/66/4d/side-view.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/b4/66/4b/looking-down-on-the-bund.jpg", "path": "en\\01_b4_66_4b_looking-down-on-the-bund.jpg", "checksum": "f7120828d81bfab2010b02fffaf71ceb"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/01/b4/66/4e/dont-go-up-when-its-cloudy.jpg", "path": "en\\01_b4_66_4e_dont-go-up-when-its-cloudy.jpg", "checksum": "d6546655eb7348b6cd4b1b688d15fb41"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/b4/66/49/looking-down-on-the-jin.jpg", "path": "en\\01_b4_66_49_looking-down-on-the-jin.jpg", "checksum": "ec840ae2d0668b068b116b242333ff95"}, {"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/b4/66/4d/side-view.jpg", "path": "en\\01_b4_66_4d_side-view.jpg", "checksum": "2b1c5ba16757b29d383af08db4b40df4"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海金融中心\\en\\01_b4_66_4b_looking-down-on-the-bund.jpg", "images_上海金融中心\\en\\01_b4_66_4e_dont-go-up-when-its-cloudy.jpg", "images_上海金融中心\\en\\01_b4_66_49_looking-down-on-the-jin.jpg", "images_上海金融中心\\en\\01_b4_66_4d_side-view.jpg"]},

Didn't see much!", "content": "The building from the outside is magnificent, and is the tallest building in the world now (excluding antennas from others). Only go up, however, when the weather is good, and in the evening when the lights are out! It was raining that time, so I couldn't see very far out (I was warned though by the ticket counter!) . It was also not cheap to go up. You have 3 options, 94/97/100 F with different prices. I took 94/97 (RMB 110), but felt 100 could have been better with the sky walk (glass) but price really goes up (RMB 150)! But since the weather was bad, it was a good choice. There was also a cafe, souveneir shops, & souvenier picture at the top. If you have your expo ticket, also bring it with you, there is 10% discount! There are also shops and restaurants at the ground floor including Din Tai Fung. So you can have dinner here, then go up to see the great skyline of Pudong and Bund across.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/9b/8d/dc/shanghai-world-financial.jpg"], "language": "en", "images": [{"url": "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/01/9b/8d/dc/shanghai-world-financial.jpg", "path": "en\\01_9b_8d_dc_shanghai-world-financial.jpg", "checksum": "4e2843d52e8c46b2275511859435eb22"}], "image_paths": ["images_上海金融中心\\en\\01_9b_8d_dc_shanghai-world-financial.jpg"]},
