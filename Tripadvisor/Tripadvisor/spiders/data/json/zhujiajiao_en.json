Then it is a short ~1-2 km walk to the town from the subway station. While most people do not speak English, restaurants have picture or translated menus and you can easily get around. It is a quite lovely town and the Gondola ride is also a fun thing to do. I recommend staying till it get dark as the lights make it particularly picturesque.

Locals can be seen buying food from street vendors while tourists explore the many souvenir shops and cafes. It is quite pleasant to walk through the many alleyways and to take a hand-operated boat on a cruise on the small canals. See if you can count and see the 36 bridges that grace the waterways.

These are the village portions of now larger communities that grew up on waterways. We chose Zhujiajiao as it is closest to Shanghai and accessible by public bus. We hopped on a bus near Peoples Park (thank you to the hotel staff who gave us detailed instructions and a note to show at the bus stop to help us find the correct bus). The price was minimal and an hour later, we disembarked in the town. We did have to wander a bit before we found the quaint park. One definitely does not need a tour to get here or enjoy it. A number of the attractions within the town require a fee. We decided to pay for those as needed rather than buying a through ticket that would provide access to all of them as we did not know how long we would stay. Narrow sidewalks line the canals with shops of all sorts from kitschy souvenirs to stores where the community shops. I was not tempted to eat in any of the small restaurants, but you might be if you are more adventuresome than me. We wandered for about an hour or so before we found the wealthy home that is known for its gardens. They are not restored to their glory, but by touring them, we got a good idea of the size of such a home - one that attracted artists and the cultured and powerful in the community - and the extent of the gardens that they had. It would take lots of effort and resources to restore the building, but it is kept in decent condition. We missed seeing the watercolor galleries - just passed by, but they looked interesting. Tired, after a few hours, we took a short boat ride down the canal back to the point where we had entered over an enticing many stepped bridge. On the outskirts there are contemporary shops. My friend loved the upscale candy shop, and I found a comfy tea shop before our return trip to the city. Buses run frequently, but know that riders queue up early. We were advised not to take a taxi as it is hard to get a taxi back to Shanghai.

Be careful as you definitely want to take the direct/fast bus!!! The slow bus will take 2-3 hours and still costs 9RMB. The water town itself is quite a slow town, there aren't as many tourists there. The market stalls inside the water town sell similar things such as traditional Chinese souvenirs (toys, clothes etc) and Chinese delicacies (cakes, pigs foot etc). It did get quite repetitive seeing the same thing. The highlight was definitely the boat ride. It costs 150RMB for a whole boat (up to 6 people) and we chose to do the long route (approx. 25mins). Very worth it, it was such a scenic ride and there were so many photo opportunities. It was also quite lovely just walking around on the bridges in the town. There are also places where you can dress up in traditional Chinese dress and have your hair/makeup done and photos professionally taken (approx. 20-30RMB).

The shopping was mostly touristy spots--if you want souvenirs you can get those in town! I would recommend spending your money and time elsewhere.

I begrudgingly handed over 10 feeling very scammed and humiliated by the whole affair. What didn't help was the torrential rain but equally nowhere to shelter unless you want to hand over lots of money for overpriced refreshments. I was also saddened by the practice of selling people goldfish to 'set free' under the bridge for good luck, how many times had those poor fish been re-caught and there were dead ones floating around the river everywhere. Another tip, if you get the bus, it's only a short walk to the town, ignore the rickshaw drivers, we accepted a lift from one as we thought we would support his business but after negotiating 2RMB each when we got there he wanted 20RMB each so the usual arguments ensued.

We were there on Tuesday, it' wasn't crowded at all. Relatively quaint, especially if you move from the main two canals. However, there is literally nothing old over there, perhaps a bridge or two. The appealing area is very small, few canals. During the 3+ hours that we spent there (we didn't do any shopping or had a meal), we walked around the place twice. Food stall after food stall, souvenir shop after souvenir shop, few bars... Same food everywhere, souvenirs are typically tacky and nothing you haven't seen if you've been to other touristy places in China. I think the best way to enjoy the place is to take a boat ride. There is no entrance fee, so you might as well pay for that. On the right side there is a canal where the locals live, you can see concrete boats, that might be interesting to some. There is also a church you can see from one of the bridges, but it's unfortunately closed. Once you cross the road from exit 2 and pass some buildings, there is a chill place to relax by the lake. Nothing special, but if you're there during some public holiday... I don't know what else to add as there is not much to see. If this is your first time in China and you want to visit one of those water towns, choose some other further from Shanghai.

Not quite what we were expecting as the canal was narrower and buildings all shops. Was expecting to see more of where people lived but we were taken along the path to look at the shops and were told some of the history. Best part of the whole visit was a tour through a private garden - part of the package tour but I saw a sign asking for 10RMB. A worthwhile visit if you like garden spaces/ rooms, bonsai, lots of fish, birds, serenity, antique furniture, artifacts and paintings. Beautiful setting. The garden is canal side not far up on the right after you enter the town. We were taken to a lunch venue located along the main alleyway of shops further upstream where the bridge is. Great meal near the water. Lots of little shops to buy small items - carved wood, embroideries, pearls, foods, parasols, silk quilts, colourful embroidered bags and even walking canes. A brief trip on a gondola took us back to the entrance. A typical guided tour where your movements were restricted by time to where the guide could find you and where you spend.

We spent 2 hours walking around People's Square, asking people if they knew where this bus stop was, nobody actually knew. So in the end, we asked this lady who helps on the Hop-On-Off bus and she directed us to across the street of the People's Square!! She told us to take the bus there, 2 stops, as it was quite far to walk but since we've walked for 2 hours around People's Square, 2 bus stops was nothing!! We finally got on the air-con bus and it costed 12 RMB for the hour ride there. The bus ended at the bus terminal. You'll need to turn left to get to the Ancient Town, about 5 - 10 mins. walk. Upon arrival, we went into the Tourist Office to ask about the admission fee. The lady showed us a list with 3 different prices: 1) 30 or 40 RMB, I can't remember, for 3 attractions, 2) 60 RMB for 4 attractions or something like that, 3) 80 RMB for 9 attractions. We weren't really interested in any of those attractions, so we asked her if we could just go in without having to pay. She then told us that if we just walk around the Ancient Town, it's free!! We walked through the narrow streets which are packed with local tourists and they were buying from the shops on those narrow streets! Boy, that was really cramped......We then walked out of it and crossed the bridge. Here, we could breathe better. We wanted to go on the boat ride which costs 65 RMB for the whole boat that could carry 6 people, but we thought that the scenery wasn't nice enough for us to enjoy so we didn't go on the ride. While walking through the streets, we didn't find any of the attractions, except for one, that needed tickets to get in. Had we bought tickets for the attractions, we couldn't even find where they were!! After spending I think, an hour or so there, we decided to head back to People's Square. We walked back to the bus terminal, a lady was shouting People's Square, so we hopped onto the bus. It was also an air-con bus. After a while, the bus started to move and the lady came to ask us to pay. We paid her 24 RMB for 2 of us, but she said it only costed 18 RMB for the 2 of us! We were surprised.....we asked why. She just replied that's what she charged. Then, after the bus had a few stops, we realized we got on the \"wrong\" bus!! We then saw the route map of this bus, and sure enough, it had MANY stops and it took 2 hours to get to People's Square!! Then when the bus came to its finally stop which was on a street, we realized that we were not dropped off at where we got on! We then asked the lady, this is not People's Square! She replied, yes, you need to walk in this direction (she pointed) then you're at People's Square! We said, ok, and started walking.......After we reached the intersection, we didn't know where to walk, so we asked a pass-byer. She told us to walk straight and we'll get to People's Square! Guess how long we must walk? 20 mins!!! OMG!!! Well, this concludes our trip and experience at Zhujiajiao. If you are going there with the public bus, make sure you ASK and when you get on the bus, make sure you LOOK for the route map. Don't make this stupid mistake like us!! If this place was nice and not too touristic, I think it would have made up for the bus ride and the walk.......!!", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

(I saw no other foreigners that day, but that's customary for me in China.). The historic area lines both sides of the river and is criss-crossed by a number of small canals. Boatmen offer rides at a very reasonable price and watching them paddle standing up is unique. There is a multitude of small shops and vendors selling a variety of items and foods that are fun to browse. My friend and I went on the Lantern Festival day (last day of the Chinese New Year holiday) and enjoyed seeing the festivities in the Kezhi Garden (which is worth visiting even on a regular day) including a dragon dance and Shanghai opera style performance.

In some places you get to see how the modern world is catching up with the rural life, nevertheless it is authentically traditional Chinese. A boat tour is a must, the scenery deserves it. As far as the commercialization, there are restaurants and stores selling everything from traditional food to arts and crafts and touristy nick-knacks.

There are several water towns near Shanghai, but this was recommended to us. The best way to get there is to go to the Shanghai Tourist Travel Centre at Gate 5 of the Shanghai Outdoor Stadium and take a bus from the Shanghai Stadium to Zhujiajiao. It costs only CNY85 (about $13.00). The price contains the admission fee and round-trip ticket. However, when we bought the tickets, no one told us that the bus makes three stops and that we should get off at the first stop in town. We stayed on the bus (the driver did not speak English) and arrived at the last stop only to find out that we should have gotten off at the first stop. We were able to get a cab back to town, along with another stranded couple. The canal winds through the old part of the town and there are about a dozen historic sites that you can visit along the canal, as well as a boat trip on the canal. These can be purchased at the tourist service center on the main road in town as you walk toward the Ancient Town. We found that the only site worth seeing was the gardens. The remainder of the canal is bordered with tourist shops and restaurants. The boat ride, while enjoyable, was short. We did get some good deals on chinese silk purses and gift bags--better than we were able to get in Beijing at the silk market. The bus picks you up in thje exact spot on the same side of the road that you were dropped off for the return trip. It was an enjoyable diversion for a day but a different ancient city might be better.", "image_urls": [], "language": "en", "images": [], "image_paths": []},

The boat ride was good and it was a really good experience, but you need to spend at least a half day or more there, not just an hour or two as was presented to us. Love the architecture, the history and stories behind the culture. Nothing like it to compare in Australia, very authentic and fascinating and well worth a visit. It was also very well maintained and the historical significance was obvious – a good honest tourist attraction. Although we did not get the opportunity, it would have been worth walking around the town which also had many historical architectural features and would offer a number of sites to visit.

Its not a big town and is easy to get around. Plus there is some good shopping there if you like to trawl the market streets. I especially enjoyed the Daoist Temple which is quite large for such a small town and is dedicated to Guinyin which is unusual in my experience. We stayed in an old wooden house out the back of one of the many restaurants that line the banks of the waterways. The house was so full of atmosphere and extremely well restored to a high standard of comfort. Walking around the town, it wasn't very busy and you could tell the proximity to Shanghai means it does get busy during the holidays. What made the visit extra special was the evening show held in a purpose built theatre with huge glass doors that open out across the waterways and reveal an old Buddhist Temple. Composed by oscar winner Tan Dun the \"Water Heavens\" show is a masterpiece fusing modern and traditional musical forms with dance, percussion and performance. While the chanting monks certainly gace the show a little extra special sauce the composition and the general sense of fun you get from the performers as they splash through their set is something else.

Once we got there it was like traveling back in time 1000 years, no cars, no noise, just local very simple people doing what they have been doing for generations. It is like venice, only water canals with ols and traditional boats, unlike Venice there are no motor boats here. The waking streets, are narrow and beautiful, you get to see the way these families live, there are plenty of art and craft stores, cozy tea houses, little restaurants with very authentic home made food. In the street markets we experience a degustation of all type of typical food, salty and sweet. We had a beautiful sunny day, with zero degrees in December, maybe in other seasons there are huge crowds like in Venice the summer time.

It felt like one of the more authentic places that we visited, and I loved the skinny streets filled with vendors and the many canals to boat down and explore.

It also gives you the opportunity to experience the water village from the water, and see the buildings and streets from a different perspective. Be sure to haggle for your purchases, as of course tourists/foreigners are charged at least 2-3X more in general. Rule is offer 1/3 initial price, never pay more than 2/3.
