Cindy only does private small groups. We let her tell us what we were seeing and we’re very happy with the tour. We felt Yu Gardens was the highlight because you were in the city but felt like you were transported to another time. The Gardens are over 450 years old and we’re made to look like they are 1000 years old. They did a great job. They added to it in recent years to look like the aged gardens were always there. The buildings and pagodas and landscaping were beautiful. I highly recommend this area for a visit and stop to visit the kiosks along the way to buy unique musical instruments or in the gardens they have some made of china and sell vases and other unique pottery and Jewlery.

The surrounding market places are visually fabulous, if no longer fully authentic. The Tea House in the centre of the market area (in the middle of the pond) is a must-do for people gazing and just immersing in the environment. The tea is expensive, but the experience is terrific – I took my elderly parents there and they loved the atmosphere and respite from buzzing crowds.

I've been to some pretty amazing places in China so this didn't really have that \"wow factor\" for me. However, it may for you and you might love it! It's very crowded to get inside the garden, but once you do it's nice. Still crowded, but nice. I would recommend this to someone who is wanting to experience their first or second China feel activity, but if you've been to the Big Buddha, the Great Wall, the Temple of Heaven, and the Summer Palace, then this just doesn't compare.

If you look at my profile, my main attraction is nature and natural places. This fits neither. I guess the attraction is that it is old and historic, which is nice but a fantastic beautiful garden it is not. Crowded, not peaceful and it is really really hard to find!!! Why? Because you have to go through a gauntlet of thousands of souvenir stands, winding paths to find it. Actually, this was the best part of the day-- great places to eat and some nice artisan and craft places on display plus the other \"tourist\" trap stuff. Again, as with most of the Shanghai, it really is a \"Chinese\" tourist site, little western help or signs. Even most of the tourist stuff is directed at the Chinese-- which is great-- they seemed to be having a good time, so was I. But, would i go out of my way to go here? No, it costs a little bit of money, which i don't mind paying, but there is a very nice \"free\" garden 1 block down that is peaceful, beautiful and truly a garden. If you spend a half hour here you are doing good. Old rocks and hundred year old wood structures, not even that nice compared to the rest of Shanghai is what you are looking at. I guess, from a preservation concept, a historic saved garden for the people to experience their history-- that is a good thing. But to say this is an excellent example of Chinese gardens or architecture is very misleading. Sorry for the negative review, but after all the reviews definitely expecting more. It is very small; i like a peaceful place but with the crowds taking selfies it is not from a western perspective. So, if you are in town, need something to do ok-- but definitely do not take a tour here or go out of your way except to shop. it closes at 5 so be careful of timing.", "image_urls": ["https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/0f/e5/3f/95/rock-2.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/e5/3f/16/rocks-tell-the-story.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-f/0f/e5/3f/6c/food-food-food.jpg", "https://ccm.ddcdn.com/ext/photo-s/0f/e5/3f/41/sign-tells-the-story.jpg"], "image_paths": ["/data1/images\\上海豫园/en/2017年7月15日-rock-2.jpg.jpg", "/data1/images\\上海豫园/en/2017年7月15日-rocks-tell-the-story.jpg.jpg", "/data1/images\\上海豫园/en/2017年7月15日-food-food-food.jpg.jpg", "/data1/images\\上海豫园/en/2017年7月15日-sign-tells-the-story.jpg.jpg"]},

This really is lovely, but head for the park as soon as you can. You can experience the retail dross on your exit.

The paths and seating areas are small, but everything flows fairly well. I really took my time and spent about 2 hours there taking in the serenity of the surroundings.

If possible, before your trip, do a little reading about the classical Chinese urban garden, often referred to as Suzhou garden style. One of the most interesting elements of such gardens is the way in which small spaces are designed so as to seem almost endless. To make small spaces seem larger, instead of the western way of opening it up, the Chinese divide it into smaller spaces that twist and turn while always giving glimpses of more to come through various techniques such as the windows that 'leak' the view from one place into another, the zig-zag paths that direct your view towards another direction. Stone is a major element inclassical gardens.

Straight away, the architecture struck as being incredibly intricate. When you look at the architecture, make sure to look both at the big picture and at the small details, like the wood carvings on the doors or the miniature statues on the roofs. It was really stunning to think about how much detail these builders put into this garden hundreds of years ago. All in all, except for the crowds, this garden really fulfilled my expectations of what a classical Chinese garden should look like and I definitely recommend it to anyone who comes to Shanghai."},

Their teas are in glass jars, which is not ideal if they sit for days, but they seemed to have good turnover.

The cost on the ginseng oolong was 36 yuan for 50g or 180 yuan for the 250g bag. We bought 3 of the 250g bags so we bargained for a discount down to 160 yuan per bag (incidentally this was roughly the same price as our tea factory and about half the price as other top quality places we saw elsewhere). There were a few tea chain stores with cute boxes and good smelling tea, but people said that tea was cheap tea and you couldn't try it there (though the price was right at 25 yuan for a little 75g tin...half the price of the good tea that I did get).

The hard selling is not necessary, just allow us to walk around and back off a bit. The gardens are stunning, great value at 45 yuan. The traditional music on the stage is great too.

The lady seemed to note our surprise and disappointment and then did a whole Chinese tea ceremony thing for us - for free. My advice is - visit this part of Shanghai because it is so different - but allow loads of time (it's quite a walk from the Metro to start off with) and be prepared for a vibrant, buzzing experience not a relaxing one."},

The garden had stunning flowers (April was a good time to visit for flower blooms), rockeries, streams and water features. The garden contains an opera house and the white walls in the garden are designed with dragons on top of them. The garden dates back to the 16th century and was built by a wealthy man in the Ming era for his father so it is very opulent. The bazaar outside of the gardens is also worth a visit. In the bazaar is the Hunxinting teahouse and a square where you can find modern shops in traditional Chinese buildings. Beautiful setting - well worth a visit."},

The shop keepers are willing to negotiate prices so feel free to dicker as their starting prices are higher than you’ll find elsewhere. I would not recommend buying any jewelry at the garden unless you’re looking for just costume. Save your money and buy jewelry at a well established shop. Or do a jewelry tour in Hong Kong.

I am really thankful to TA and reviewer that they saved us from lot of trouble. Another incident happened in the evening when we were returning after visiting the garden, we were very happy that we got chance to see such beautiful place but then suddenly one projector pointer seller started following us and keep forcing to buy and keep touching me. I asked for price and he said ¥200 and I said I don't want to buy but he kept following us and forcing to buy, then I said I will give ¥20 for it and he said ok, when I gave him money he said US$20 not ¥20 and started hitting on my head then me and my shouted and said we are calling the police and we started walking and didn't look back.

They took me to a shop where the three of us were entertained for the better part of an hour (in a small, closed room) by a young woman who gave us samples of several teas. The cost was presented up-front as $8 for tea, and $7 for the presenter -- only later (when the bill comes) are you advised that each tea is charged separately, and you now owe them more than $50. I found it easier to fork over the cash than risk unknown consequences of refusal, but needless to say, I was not a happy camper.

The walk from the coach to the Garden was just crazy! I had never experienced anything like it in my life even though I am very used to the craziness of London! We had to walk through tiny back streets, cut across a park, and zig zag in and out of what seemed like thousands of Chinese all intent on selling us wheels to add to our trainers and other dubious accessories....some were jovial and pleasant....others were actually quite unpleasant, shouting in our faces and jostling us roughly. As a first experience of China it was a culture shock! I wish it had been possible to walk slowly and take in the scene as we were actually walking through what appeared to be the real Shanghai....people buying goods from tiny back street shops and hanging their laundry (yes including their bras and pants!) along the park railings to dry in the sun!). Anyway we were pleased to be inside the beautiful Yu Yuan Gardens....really peaceful and beautiful (in April)....and really enjoyed wandering along the little paths and around the ponds and bridges. Our tour guide did an excellent job of filling us in with all the historical facts. We found it very atmospheric...and quite bizarre in that such a tranquil ancient place looked as if it had been dropped into one of the noisiest, crowded spots on earth (obviously it was there first but it was slightly incongruous!). We came out of the back door....and were thrust into the frenzy again! Hoards of (mainly Chinese) tourists fighting for space around the famous tea house, the zig zag bridge, and the souvenir/food shops. At that time we appeared to be the only European tourists there, and we were a source of great amusement and curiosity to the Chinese tourists (not the city people) who variously stared or asked to take photos of us! I absolutely loved our stay in Shanghai (as my dad had done many years before!) it was as crazy, frenetic and noisy as I'd imagined.......and the Yu Yuan Gardens are a lovely oasis of calm in the midst of it all!"},

You'll get more out of it with a guide, but even if not, it's a beautiful introduction to Chinese traditions."},

It's an old look town, with really good priced souveniers in the perimeter of the main square. There are a TON of restaurants inside of the main area (everything from a Dairy Queen to Chinese food a la cafeteria style). They sell EVERYTHING inside... tea sets, stamps, jade, pearls, paintings, etc. Then you go into the garden itself. Usually there's not that many people inside, although you'd think it would be packed judging from the people outside. Inside of the gardens there are several shops and \"exhibitions\". DO NOT buy anything inside unless it's a painting or something you MUST have. Let's just say that although I pride myself on my shopping skills, it was my first stop in China and I bought chopsticks for 100 yuan (down from 170, what a deal....yeah right) which I then saw outside of the main perimeter for 8 yuans. Yes, 8 yuans.... please learn from my mistakes! Otherwise, enjoy this beautiful place, and make sure to look at the architecture above, lots of the stores are on the second or third floors as well."},

The Yu Garden, was deeply hidden inside the market area. It cost 30 RMB (about $5 USD) to tour it. It was EVERYTHING you see in the photos- Beautiful! It was very busy on the Saturday I went, which I heard it wasn't too busy during the week. I loved the Koi and architect buildings. It was also very neat I was touring a 500-700 year old garden. This is a Koi lover's dream. The market was also neat, but packed with people. It had modern places like Starbucks, Dairy Queen, etc also with many local shops. The locals love to approch you and ask if you want an IPAD or ROLEX. I guess those are popular knock offs there. It was fun at first, but got quiet annoying with the people pecking you wanting to sale something.

I would recommend this for buying things that don't cost much and not for any major or special purchase - go to a reputable shop for those. The Silk Market is well worth going to - the silk quilts are a particularly good buy if you have room in your suitcase or hand luggage.

There are many foreigner groups wondering everywhere, and every 10 meters or so you are stopped by the fake stuff sellers (bangs & watches predominantly). Nevertheless, if you plan to have a remarcable souvenir from China or you want to pamper your lady (or if you are a lady to make yourself an exquisite present) Yu Yuan shopping area is the place - for Jade. Here there are many shops selling Jade (true and certified one). True jade is always (very) expensive, reaching to several thousands EUR for a unique pattern, deep green Jade bracelet. For the budget seekers, the little more cheaper white Jade (called \"Mutton Fat\") is as well available at rather hundreds EUR per bracelet. Furthermore the area is filled with Tea Shops, Chinese Medicinal Herbs Farmacies, etc. Give it a try!"},

The intricacy of the workmanship on the buildings is pretty amazing...if you take the time to look at it...and you are not be overwhelmed by the crowds. The main dumpling restaurant (world famous) is worth a wait. It is easy to find as the cue for their takeout window is often a 100 meters long. Sometimes waiting for a table upstairs is shorter than takeout. As the title of my review says... i recommend exploring the areas outside the actual boundries of Yu Garden.
